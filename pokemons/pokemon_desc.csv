0524,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']",They were discovered a hundred years ago in an earthquake fissure. Inside each one is an energy core.
0524,['Sun'],"Born deep within the ground, it compares itself with similar species, such as Geodude and Carbink, to settle which has the hardest body."
0524,['Moon'],"The hexagonal cavity is its ear. It walks in the direction of sounds it hears, but if the sounds cease, it panics and topples over."
0524,['Ultra Sun'],"The hexagonal hole is its ear. Deep in that ear is an energy core, so if you stick your hand in there, Roggenrola will be very angry!"
0524,['Ultra Moon'],It was found in a fissure in a layer of exposed rock. The material that makes up its body is dirt from several hundred years ago.
0524,['Sword'],"It’s as hard as steel, but apparently a long soak in water will cause it to soften a bit."
0524,['Shield'],"When it detects a noise, it starts to move. The energy core inside it makes this Pokémon slightly warm to the touch."
0525,['Black'],"When it overflows with power, the orange crystal on its body glows. It looks for underground water in caves."
0525,['White'],"Because its energy was too great to be contained, the energy leaked and formed orange crystals."

0525,['Sun'],Its orange crystal is a mass of energy. Just one crystal fragment would provide enough fuel for a hundred dump trucks.
0525,['Moon'],"It explores caves in search of underground water. It’s not comfortable around water, so this Pokémon takes great care in lapping it up."
0525,['Ultra Sun'],The energy overflowing from its body has turned into orange crystals that are hard enough to smash diamonds.
0525,['Ultra Moon'],"Its orange crystals are lumps of powerful energy. They’re valuable, so Boldore is sometimes targeted for them."
0525,['Sword'],"If you see its orange crystals start to glow, be wary. It’s about to fire off bursts of energy."
0525,['Shield'],"It relies on sound in order to monitor what’s in its vicinity. When angered, it will attack without ever changing the direction it’s facing."
0526,['Black'],Compressing the energy from its internal core lets it fire off an attack capable of blowing away a mountain.
0526,['White'],The solar energy absorbed by its body’s orange crystals is magnified internally and fired from its mouth.

0526,['Sword'],"This hardy Pokémon can often be found on construction sites and in mines, working alongside people and Copperajah."
0526,['Shield'],"Although its energy blasts can blow away a dump truck, they have a limitation— they can only be fired when the sun is out."
0527,['Black'],Its habitat is dark forests and caves. It emits ultrasonic waves from its nose to learn about its surroundings.
0527,['White'],Suction from its nostrils enables it to stick to cave walls during sleep. It leaves a heart-shaped mark behind.
0527,"['Black 2', 'White 2']",The heart-shaped mark left on a body after a Woobat has been attached to it is said to bring good fortune.

0528,['Sword'],"Emitting powerful sound waves tires it out. Afterward, it won’t be able to fly for a little while."
0528,['Shield'],The auspicious shape of this Pokémon’s nose apparently led some regions to consider Swoobat a symbol of good luck.

0533,['Sword'],"It shows off its muscles to Machoke and other Gurdurr. If it fails to measure up to the other Pokémon, it lies low for a little while."
0533,['Shield'],"Gurdurr excels at demolition—construction is not its forte. In any case, there’s skill in the way this Pokémon wields its metal beam."
0534,['Black'],"It is thought that Conkeldurr taught humans how to make concrete more than 2,000 years ago."
0534,['White'],They use concrete pillars as walking canes. They know moves that enable them to swing the pillars freely in battle.

0669,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","When it finds a flower it likes, it dwells on that flower its whole life long. It floats in the wind’s embrace with an untroubled heart."
0669,['Ultra Sun'],"It’s not safe without the power of a flower, but it will keep traveling around until it finds one with the color and shape it wants."
0669,['Ultra Moon'],Flabébé wears a crown made from pollen it’s collected from its flower. The crown has hidden healing properties.
0670,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']",It flutters around fields of flowers and cares for flowers that are starting to wilt. It draws out the hidden power of flowers to battle.
0670,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","When the flowers of a well-tended flower bed bloom, it appears and celebrates with an elegant dance."
0670,['Ultra Sun'],"It raises flowers and uses them as weapons. The more gorgeous the blossom, the more power it contains."
0670,['Ultra Moon'],"It gives its own power to flowers, pouring its heart into caring for them. Floette never forgives anyone who messes up a flower bed."
0671,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","It claims exquisite flower gardens as its territory, and it obtains power from basking in the energy emitted by flowering plants."
0671,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","In times long past, governors of castles would invite Florges to create flower gardens to embellish the castle domains."
0671,['Ultra Sun'],It controls the flowers it grows. The petal blizzards that Florges triggers are overwhelming in their beauty and power.
0671,['Ultra Moon'],Its life can span several hundred years. It’s said to devote its entire life to protecting gardens.
0672,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","Thought to be one of the first Pokémon to live in harmony with humans, it has a placid disposition."
0672,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","If it has sunshine and water, it doesn’t need to eat, because it can generate energy from the leaves on its back."
0672,['Scarlet'],"Until recently, people living in the mountains would ride on the backs of these Pokémon to traverse the mountain paths."
0672,['Violet'],"As long as it has sunlight and water, Skiddo can make energy with the leaves on its body, allowing it to live on rocky mountains barren of food."
0673,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']",It can tell how its Trainer is feeling by subtle shifts in the grip on its horns. This empathic sense lets them run as if one being.
0673,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']",They inhabit mountainous regions. The leader of the herd is decided by a battle of clashing horns.
0673,['Scarlet'],"It can sense the feelings of others by touching them with its horns. This species has assisted people with their work since 5,000 years ago."
0673,['Violet'],These Pokémon live in herds in mountainous places. The victor in their contests of clashing horns will become the leader of the herd.
0674,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","It does its best to be taken seriously by its enemies, but its glare is not sufficiently intimidating. Chewing on a leaf is its trademark."
0674,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","It does its level best to glare and pull a scary face, but it can’t help grinning if anyone pats its head."
0674,['Sun'],"It grows up imitating the behavior of Pangoro, which it looks up to as a leader."
0674,['Moon'],"There’s no point to the leaf in its mouth, aside from an effort to look cool. It’s mischievous, so it’s not well suited to inexperienced Trainers."
0674,['Ultra Sun'],"It follows Pangoro around like a henchman. When Pancham makes a big mistake, its leaf gets taken away."
0674,['Ultra Moon'],It’s desperate to intimidate its opponents. Be nice and pretend to be scared if you catch it glaring at you intensely.
0674,['Sword'],It chooses a Pangoro as its master and then imitates its master’s actions. This is how it learns to battle and hunt for prey.
0674,['Shield'],"Wanting to make sure it’s taken seriously, Pancham’s always giving others a glare. But if it’s not focusing, it ends up smiling."
0675,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","Although it possesses a violent temperament, it won’t put up with bullying. It uses the leaf in its mouth to sense the movements of its enemies."
0675,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","It charges ahead and bashes its opponents like a berserker, uncaring about any hits it might take. Its arms are mighty enough to snap a telephone pole."
0675,['Sun'],It boasts superb physical strength. Those who wish to become Pangoro’s Trainer have no choice but to converse with their fists.
0675,['Moon'],"From the slight twitches of its bamboo leaf, it deduces its opponent’s movements. It’s eager to tussle but kindhearted toward its companions."
0675,['Ultra Sun'],This rowdy Pokémon boasts great physical strength. Many Trainers are also smitten by its lively character.
0675,['Ultra Moon'],Pangoro is the type to talk with its fists. It doesn’t say much as it pummels opponents with enough force to send a dump truck flying.
0675,['Sword'],"This Pokémon is quick to anger, and it has no problem using its prodigious strength to get its way. It lives for duels against Obstagoon."
0675,['Shield'],"Using its leaf, Pangoro can predict the moves of its opponents. It strikes with punches that can turn a dump truck into scrap with just one hit."
0676,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']",Trimming its fluffy fur not only makes it more elegant but also increases the swiftness of its movements.
0676,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","Historically, in the Kalos region, these Pokémon were the designated guardians of the king."
0676,['Ultra Sun'],There was an era when aristocrats would compete to see who could trim their Furfrou’s fur into the most exquisite style.
0676,['Ultra Moon'],"Left alone, its fur will grow longer and longer, but it will only allow someone it trusts to cut it."
0677,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']",The organ that emits its intense psychic power is sheltered by its ears to keep power from leaking out.
0677,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","It has enough psychic energy to blast everything within 300 feet of itself, but it has no control over its power."
0677,['Sword'],"Though Espurr’s expression never changes, behind that blank stare is an intense struggle to contain its devastating psychic power."
0677,['Shield'],"There’s enough psychic power in Espurr to send a wrestler flying, but because this power can’t be controlled, Espurr finds it troublesome."
0678,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","When in danger, it raises its ears and releases enough psychic power to grind a 10-ton truck into dust."
0678,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']",The eyeball patterns on the interior of its ears emit psychic energy. It keeps the patterns tightly covered because that power is too immense.
0678,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","When in danger, it raises its ears and releases enough psychic power to grind a 10-ton truck into dust."
0678,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']",The eyeball patterns on the interior of its ears emit psychic energy. It keeps the patterns tightly covered because that power is too immense.
0679,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']",Apparently this Pokémon is born when a departed spirit inhabits a sword. It attaches itself to people and drinks their life force.
0679,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","If anyone dares to grab its hilt, it wraps a blue cloth around that person’s arm and drains that person’s life energy completely."
0679,['Sword'],Honedge’s soul once belonged to a person who was killed a long time ago by the sword that makes up Honedge’s body.
0679,['Shield'],"The blue eye on the sword’s handguard is the true body of Honedge. With its old cloth, it drains people’s lives away."
0680,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","When Honedge evolves, it divides into two swords, which cooperate via telepathy to coordinate attacks and slash their enemies to ribbons."
0680,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","The complex attack patterns of its two swords are unstoppable, even for an opponent greatly accomplished at swordplay."
0680,['Sword'],Honedge evolves into twins. The two blades rub together to emit a metallic sound that unnerves opponents.
0680,['Shield'],The two swords employ a strategy of rapidly alternating between offense and defense to bring down their prey.
0681,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","Generations of kings were attended by these Pokémon, which used their spectral power to manipulate and control people and Pokémon."
0681,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","Apparently, it can detect the innate qualities of leadership. According to legend, whoever it recognizes is destined to become king."
0681,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","Generations of kings were attended by these Pokémon, which used their spectral power to manipulate and control people and Pokémon."
0681,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","Apparently, it can detect the innate qualities of leadership. According to legend, whoever it recognizes is destined to become king."
0682,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']",It emits a scent that enraptures those who smell it. This fragrance changes depending on what it has eaten.
0682,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","In the past, rather than using perfume, royal ladies carried a Spritzee that would waft a fragrance they liked."
0682,['Sword'],A scent pouch within this Pokémon’s body allows it to create various scents. A change in its diet will alter the fragrance it produces.
0682,['Shield'],The scent its body gives off enraptures those who smell it. Noble ladies had no shortage of love for Spritzee.
0683,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","It devises various scents, pleasant and unpleasant, and emits scents that its enemies dislike in order to gain an edge in battle."
0683,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","Its scent is so overpowering that, unless a Trainer happens to really enjoy the smell, he or she will have a hard time walking alongside it."
0683,['Sword'],The scent that constantly emits from its fur is so powerful that this Pokémon’s companions will eventually lose their sense of smell.
0683,['Shield'],The scents Aromatisse can produce range from sweet smells that bolster allies to foul smells that sap an opponent’s will to fight.
0684,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","To entangle its opponents in battle, it extrudes white threads as sweet and sticky as cotton candy."
0684,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","Because it eats nothing but sweets, its fur is as sticky sweet as cotton candy."
0684,['Sword'],"It eats its own weight in sugar every day. If it doesn’t get enough sugar, it becomes incredibly grumpy."
0684,['Shield'],The sweet smell of cotton candy perfumes Swirlix’s fluffy fur. This Pokémon spits out sticky string to tangle up its enemies.
0685,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']",It can distinguish the faintest of scents. It puts its sensitive sense of smell to use by helping pastry chefs in their work.
0685,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","Its sense of smell is 100 million times better than a human’s, so even the faintest scent tells it about everything in the area. It’s like it can see with its nose!"
0685,['Sword'],"By taking in a person’s scent, it can sniff out their mental and physical condition. It’s hoped that this skill will have many medical applications."
0685,['Shield'],"Slurpuff’s fur contains a lot of air, making it soft to the touch and lighter than it looks."
0686,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']",Opponents who stare at the flashing of the light-emitting spots on its body become dazed and lose their will to fight.
0686,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","It flashes the light-emitting spots on its body, which drains its opponent’s will to fight. It takes the opportunity to scuttle away and hide."
0686,['Ultra Sun'],It draws prey near with its blinking lights and then wraps them up in its long tentacles and holds them in place.
0686,['Ultra Moon'],"When exchanging information with others of its kind, it flashes the light-emitting spots on its body in a complex rhythm."
0686,['Sword'],It spins while making its luminescent spots flash. These spots allow it to communicate with others by using different patterns of light.
0686,['Shield'],"By exposing foes to the blinking of its luminescent spots, Inkay demoralizes them, and then it seizes the chance to flee."
0687,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","It wields the most compelling hypnotic powers of any Pokémon, and it forces others to do whatever it wants."
0687,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","It lures its prey close with hypnotic motions, then wraps its tentacles around it before finishing it off with digestive fluids."
0687,['Ultra Sun'],"When it comes to strong hypnosis, there’s an endless number of people who utilize Malamar for their nefarious deeds."
0687,['Ultra Moon'],It flashes the pattern on its torso to control its prey and draw them in. The edges of its fins are supremely sharp.
0687,['Sword'],"Gazing at its luminescent spots will quickly induce a hypnotic state, putting the observer under Malamar’s control."
0687,['Shield'],It’s said that Malamar’s hypnotic powers played a role in certain history-changing events.
0688,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","Two Binacle live together on one rock. When they fight, one of them will move to a different rock."
0688,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","They stretch and then contract, yanking their rocks along with them in bold hops. They eat seaweed that washes up on the shoreline."
0688,['Sword'],"After two Binacle find a suitably sized rock, they adhere themselves to it and live together. They cooperate to gather food during high tide."
0688,['Shield'],"If the two don’t work well together, both their offense and defense fall apart. Without good teamwork, they won’t survive."
0689,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","When they evolve, two Binacle multiply into seven. They fight with the power of seven Binacle."
0689,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","Barbaracle’s legs and hands have minds of their own, and they will move independently. But they usually follow the head’s orders."
0689,['Sword'],Seven Binacle come together to form one Barbaracle. The Binacle that serves as the head gives orders to those serving as the limbs.
0689,['Shield'],"Having an eye on each palm allows it to keep watch in all directions. In a pinch, its limbs start to act on their own to ensure the enemy’s defeat."
0690,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","Camouflaged as rotten kelp, they spray liquid poison on prey that approaches unawares and then finish it off."
0690,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']",It looks just like rotten kelp. It hides from foes while storing up power for its evolution.
0690,['Ultra Sun'],It vanishes into seaweed and remains perfectly still to avoid attacks from large Pokémon. Rotten seaweed is its main food source.
0690,['Ultra Moon'],"It’s not good at swimming, so it clings to the seaweed. In the Alola region, it’s often found near Dhelmise."
0690,['Sword'],"It drifts in the ocean, blending in with floating seaweed. When other Pokémon come to feast on the seaweed, Skrelp feasts on them instead."
0690,['Shield'],"Skrelp looks like a piece of rotten seaweed, so it can blend in with seaweed drifting on the ocean and avoid being detected by enemies."
0690,['Scarlet'],Skrelp evades its enemies by hiding amid drifting seaweed. It eats rotten seaweed to create its poison.
0690,['Violet'],"This Pokémon is a poor swimmer. If it’s caught in a fierce storm, it will sometimes get washed far away and become unable to return to its home."
0691,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","Their poison is strong enough to eat through the hull of a tanker, and they spit it indiscriminately at anything that enters their territory."
0691,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","Tales are told of ships that wander into seas where Dragalge live, never to return."
0691,['Ultra Sun'],"This vicious Pokémon sprays a poisonous liquid on opponents that come near. For whatever reason, it gets along really well with Dhelmise."
0691,['Ultra Moon'],It blends in with seaweed to ambush its prey and then takes them down with a poisonous liquid strong enough to melt metal.
0691,['Sword'],Dragalge uses a poisonous liquid capable of corroding metal to send tankers that enter its territory to the bottom of the sea.
0691,['Shield'],Dragalge generates dragon energy by sticking the plume on its head out above the ocean’s surface and bathing it in sunlight.
0691,['Scarlet'],"Using a liquid poison, Dragalge indiscriminately attacks anything that wanders into its territory. This poison can corrode the undersides of boats."
0691,['Violet'],"Since Finizen is the better swimmer, Dragalge will approach it under the cover of seaweed, then immobilize it with a poisonous attack."
0692,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']",They knock down flying prey by firing compressed water from their massive claws like shooting a pistol.
0692,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","Through controlled explosions of internal gas, it can expel water like a pistol shot. At close distances, it can shatter rock."
0692,['Ultra Sun'],"Its claws occasionally fall off, and it keeps a low profile until they grow back. The meat of its claws is so delicious!"
0692,['Ultra Moon'],"It moves around by jetting water from its right pincer. It has a poor sense of balance, so it’s terrible at swimming straight."
0692,['Sword'],"Clauncher’s claws can fall off during battle, but they’ll regenerate. The meat inside the claws is popular as a delicacy in Galar."
0692,['Shield'],"By detonating gas that accumulates in its right claw, this Pokémon launches water like a bullet. This is how Clauncher defeats its enemies."
0692,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon launches water by detonating gas inside its right claw. It snipes flying Pokémon.
0692,['Violet'],"Clauncher’s claws will regrow if they fall off. The meat inside the claws is edible, but it has a distinct flavor that doesn’t appeal to all tastes."
0693,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']",Their enormous claws launch cannonballs of water powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls.
0693,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","By expelling water from the nozzle in the back of its claw, it can move at a speed of 60 knots."
0693,['Ultra Sun'],It compresses the water it has sucked up and then projects it with enough power to punch a hole right through a thick sheet of iron.
0693,['Ultra Moon'],"Its right arm is packed with meat. When its pincer falls off, it’s exported to be used as a cooking ingredient."
0693,['Sword'],"After using the feelers on its oversized claw to detect the location of prey, Clawitzer launches a cannonball of water at its target."
0693,['Shield'],Clawitzer’s right arm is a cannon that launches projectiles made of seawater. Shots from a Clawitzer’s cannon arm can sink a tanker.
0693,['Scarlet'],Clawitzer can move through the water at a speed of 60 knots by using gas inside its body to expel water from the back of its claw.
0693,['Violet'],The cannonballs of seawater that Clawitzer launches from its claw are powerful enough to punch through tanker hulls.
0694,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","They make their home in deserts. They can generate their energy from basking in the sun, so eating food is not a requirement."
0694,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']",The frills on either side of its head have cells that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight.
0694,['Sword'],"When spread, the frills on its head act like solar panels, generating the power behind this Pokémon’s electric moves."
0694,['Shield'],The sun powers this Pokémon’s electricity generation. Interruption of that process stresses Helioptile to the point of weakness.
0695,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']",They flare their frills and generate energy. A single Heliolisk can generate sufficient electricity to power a skyscraper.
0695,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","It stimulates its muscles with electricity, boosting the strength in its legs and enabling it to run 100 yards in five seconds."
0695,['Sword'],"A now-vanished desert culture treasured these Pokémon. Appropriately, when Heliolisk came to the Galar region, treasure came with them."
0695,['Shield'],One Heliolisk basking in the sun with its frill outspread is all it would take to produce enough electricity to power a city.
0696,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","This Pokémon was restored from a fossil. If something happens that it doesn’t like, it throws a tantrum and runs wild."
0696,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']",Its immense jaws have enough destructive force that it can chew up an automobile. It lived 100 million years ago.
0696,['Ultra Sun'],Its large jaw has incredible destructive power. Some theories suggest that its restored form is different from its form of long ago.
0696,['Ultra Moon'],"Tyrunt is spoiled and selfish. It may just be trying to frolic, but sometimes the ones it’s trying to frolic with are gravely injured."
0696,['Sword'],"This is an ancient Pokémon, revived in modern times. It has a violent disposition, and it’ll tear apart anything it gets between its hefty jaws."
0696,['Shield'],This Pokémon is selfish and likes to be pampered. It can also inflict grievous wounds on its Trainer just by playing around.
0697,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","Thanks to its gargantuan jaws, which could shred thick metal plates as if they were paper, it was invincible in the ancient world it once inhabited."
0697,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","Nothing could stop this Pokémon 100 million years ago, so it behaved like a king."
0697,['Ultra Sun'],"Complete restoration is impossible, allowing room for theories that its entire body was once covered in a feather-like coat."
0697,['Ultra Moon'],"The king of the ancient world, it can easily crunch a car with the devastating strength of its enormous jaws."
0697,['Sword'],"This Pokémon is from about 100,000,000 years ago. It has the presence of a king, vicious but magnificent."
0697,['Shield'],A single bite of Tyrantrum’s massive jaws will demolish a car. This Pokémon was the king of the ancient world.
0698,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']",This ancient Pokémon was restored from part of its body that had been frozen in ice for over 100 million years.
0698,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']",This calm Pokémon lived in a cold land where there were no violent predators like Tyrantrum.
0698,['Ultra Sun'],"It lived in cold areas in ancient times. It’s said that when Amaura whinnies, auroras appear in the night sky."
0698,['Ultra Moon'],"Amaura was restored successfully, but it’s not expected to live long because of the heat of the current environment."
0698,['Sword'],"This Pokémon was successfully restored from a fossil. In the past, it lived with others of its kind in cold lands where there were fewer predators."
0698,['Shield'],Amaura is an ancient Pokémon that has gone extinct. Specimens of this species can sometimes be found frozen in ice.
0699,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","The diamond-shaped crystals on its body expel air as cold as -240 degrees Fahrenheit, surrounding its enemies and encasing them in ice."
0699,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","Using its diamond-shaped crystals, it can instantly create a wall of ice to block an opponent’s attack."
0699,['Ultra Sun'],"An Aurorus was found frozen solid within a glacier, just as it appeared long ago, which became quite a big event in the news."
0699,['Ultra Moon'],This usually quiet and kindly Pokémon has a surface temperature of around –240 degrees Fahrenheit.
0699,['Sword'],"Aurorus was restored from a fossil. It’s said that when this Pokémon howls, auroras appear in the night sky."
0699,['Shield'],"When gripped by rage, Aurorus will emanate freezing air, covering everything around it in ice."
0700,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']",It sends a soothing aura from its ribbonlike feelers to calm fights.
0700,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']",It wraps its ribbonlike feelers around the arm of its beloved Trainer and walks with him or her.
0700,['Sun'],"Its ribbonlike feelers give off an aura that weakens hostility in its prey, causing them to let down their guard. Then it attacks."
0700,['Moon'],"When this Pokémon sights its prey, it swirls its ribbonlike feelers as a distraction. A moment later, it pounces."
0700,['Ultra Sun'],"Once a fight breaks out, it will unflinchingly charge at dragon Pokémon that are many times larger than itself."
0700,['Ultra Moon'],Sylveon wraps its ribbonlike feelers around its Trainer’s arm because this touch enables it to read its Trainer’s feelings.
0700,['Sword'],"By releasing enmity-erasing waves from its ribbonlike feelers, Sylveon stops any conflict."
0700,['Shield'],There’s a Galarian fairy tale that describes a beautiful Sylveon vanquishing a dreadful dragon Pokémon.
0700,['Legends: Arceus'],It emits a soothing aura from its ribbon-shaped organs. It wraps these appendages around quarrelers to instantly restore calm to the situation.
0700,['Scarlet'],"This Pokémon uses its ribbonlike feelers to send a soothing aura into its opponents, erasing their hostility."
0700,['Violet'],"Sylveon cuts an elegant figure as it dances lightly around, feelers fluttering, but its piercing moves aim straight for its opponents’ weak spots."
0701,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","Although its body is small, its proficient fighting skills enable it to keep up with big bruisers like Machamp and Hariyama."
0701,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","With its wings, it controls its position in the air. It likes to attack from above, a maneuver that is difficult to defend against."
0701,['Ultra Sun'],"It overwhelms opponents with quick moves, but sometimes it showboats for too long when it’s using a special move and gets itself into a pinch."
0701,['Ultra Moon'],"In combat, Hawlucha leaps nimbly about, taking advantage of its opponents’ blind spots. It’s also skilled at using superb submission holds."
0701,['Sword'],"It drives its opponents to exhaustion with its agile maneuvers, then ends the fight with a flashy finishing move."
0701,['Shield'],It always strikes a pose before going for its finishing move. Sometimes opponents take advantage of that time to counterattack.
0701,['Scarlet'],Its elegant finishing moves—performed by nimbly leaping around using its wings—are polished in the forest where it was born and raised.
0701,['Violet'],Hawlucha live quietly without flocking together. They fight constantly with their natural enemies: noisy groups of Primeape.
0702,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","Its whiskers serve as antennas. By sending and receiving electrical waves, it can communicate with others over vast distances."
0702,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']","It uses its tail to absorb electricity from power plants or from outlets in houses, and then it fires the electricity from its whiskers."
0702,['Ultra Sun'],"It sneaks into people’s homes and steals electricity from their outlets. When your electric bill seems off, it’s the handiwork of this rascal."
0702,['Ultra Moon'],Its upper whiskers are sensors that survey its surroundings. Its lower whiskers are organs that shoot electricity.
0702,['Sword'],A Dedenne’s whiskers pick up electrical waves other Dedenne send out. These Pokémon share locations of food or electricity with one another.
0702,['Shield'],"Since Dedenne can’t generate much electricity on its own, it steals electricity from outlets or other electric Pokémon."
0702,['Scarlet'],"It’s small and its electricity-generating organ is not fully developed, so it uses its tail to absorb electricity from people’s homes and charge itself."
0702,['Violet'],"Dedenne emit electrical waves from the whiskers on their cheeks to communicate with each other. When low on electricity, they curl up and sleep."
0703,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","Born from the temperatures and pressures deep underground, it fires beams from the stone in its head."
0703,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']",It has slept underground for hundreds of millions of years since its birth. It’s occasionally found during the excavation of caves.
0703,['Sun'],"Born from the high temperatures and pressures deep underground, it defends itself by firing beams from the jewel part of its body."
0703,['Moon'],"Although this Pokémon is not especially rare, its glittering, jewel-draped body draws attention from people."
0703,['Ultra Sun'],"Some say that deep beneath the surface of the world, a pack of Carbink live with their queen in a kingdom of jewels."
0703,['Ultra Moon'],"To keep the jewels on their bodies free of tarnish, packs of Carbink use their soft manes to polish one another’s jewels."
0703,['Sword'],"When beset by attackers, Carbink wipes them all out by firing high-energy beams from the gems embedded in its body."
0703,['Shield'],"It’s said that somewhere in the world, there’s a mineral vein housing a large pack of slumbering Carbink. It’s also said that this pack has a queen."
0704,"['X', 'Omega Ruby']","The weakest Dragon-type Pokémon, it lives in damp, shady places, so its body doesn’t dry out."
0704,"['Y', 'Alpha Sapphire']",It’s covered in a slimy membrane that makes any punches or kicks slide off it harmlessly.
0704,['Sun'],"The weakest of all Dragon-type Pokémon, it’s unable to breathe if its skin dries out, so it sticks to shady places."
0704,['Moon'],"Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden mucous membrane. Anyone who touches it needs some thorough hand-washing."
0704,['Ultra Sun'],"It uses its horns to check out its surroundings. They’re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it will feel a strong shock and be unable to move."
0704,['Ultra Moon'],"Its body is mostly water. If it dries out, it will die, so it’s always sitting with perfect stillness in the shade."
0704,['Sword'],"Because most of its body is water, it will dry up if the weather becomes too arid. It’s considered the weakest dragon Pokémon."
0704,['Shield'],"Their horns are powerful sensors. As soon as Goomy pick up any sign of enemies, they go into hiding. This is how they’ve survived."
0704,['Legends: Arceus'],"Goomy hides away in the shade of trees, where it’s nice and humid. If the slime coating its body dries out, the Pokémon instantly becomes lethargic."

0729,['Sword'],"As if dancing, it artfully dodges the attacks of its enemies. All the while, it’s busy forming a bunch of balloons to overwhelm its foes."
0729,['Shield'],"On nights when the sea is calm, Brionne dance with one another to the singing of the Primarina that’s leading them."
0730,['Sun'],It controls its water balloons with song. The melody is learned from others of its kind and is passed down from one generation to the next.
0730,['Moon'],Its singing voice is its chief weapon in battle. This Pokémon’s Trainer must prioritize the daily maintenance of its throat at all costs.
0730,['Ultra Sun'],"To Primarina, every battle is a stage. It takes down its prey with beautiful singing and dancing."
0730,['Ultra Moon'],"Also known as a songstress, it has a fantastical look on moonlit nights when it leads its colony in song."
0730,['Sword'],"With its mouth, it makes sonic waves that sound like beautiful singing. It uses the sonic waves to control its water balloons."
0730,['Shield'],"For Primarina, every battle’s a stage. Its singing and the dancing of its balloons will mesmerize the audience."
0731,['Sun'],It can peck at a rate of 16 times a second to drill holes in trees. It uses the holes for food storage and for nesting.
0731,['Moon'],"This Pokémon feeds on berries, whose leftover seeds become the ammunition for the attacks it fires off from its mouth."
0731,['Ultra Sun'],It pecks at trees with its hard beak. You can get some idea of its mood or condition from the rhythm of its pecking.
0731,['Ultra Moon'],"It may look spindly, but its neck muscles are heavy-duty. It can peck at a tree 16 times per second!"
0732,['Sun'],"It eats berries and stores their seeds in its beak. When it encounters enemies or prey, it fires off all the seeds in a burst."
0732,['Moon'],"By bending its beak, it can produce a variety of calls and brand itself a noisy nuisance for its neighbors."
0732,['Ultra Sun'],It can bend the tip of its beak to produce over a hundred different cries at will.
0732,['Ultra Moon'],"From its mouth, it fires the seeds of berries it has eaten. The scattered seeds give rise to new plants."
0733,['Sun'],"When it battles, its beak heats up. The temperature can easily exceed 212 degrees Fahrenheit, causing severe burns when it hits."
0733,['Moon'],"Within its beak, its internal gas ignites, explosively launching seeds with enough power to pulverize boulders."
0733,['Ultra Sun'],They smack beaks with others of their kind to communicate. The strength and number of hits tell each other how they feel.
0733,['Ultra Moon'],"Known for forming harmonious couples, this Pokémon is brought to wedding ceremonies as a good luck charm."
0734,['Sun'],"With its sharp fangs, it will bite anything. It did not originally live in Alola but was imported from another region."
0734,['Moon'],"It wanders around in a never-ending search for food. At dusk, it collapses from exhaustion and falls asleep on the spot."
0734,['Ultra Sun'],"Its stomach takes up most of its long torso. It’s a big eater, so the amount Trainers have to spend on its food is no laughing matter."
0734,['Ultra Moon'],"Although it will eat anything, it prefers fresh living things, so it marches down streets in search of prey."
0734,['Scarlet'],"Its stomach fills most of its torso. It wanders the same path every day, searching for fresh food."
0734,['Violet'],"It spends its waking hours searching endlessly for food. When Yungoos is hungry, its ferocity gains a certain edge."
0735,['Sun'],"When it finds a trace of its prey, it patiently stakes out the location...but it’s always snoozing by nightfall."
0735,['Moon'],"It adores having Rattata and Raticate for dinner, but as it’s diurnal, it never encounters them. This Pokémon boasts incredible patience."
0735,['Ultra Sun'],"Although it wasn’t originally found in Alola, this Pokémon was brought over a long time ago when there was a huge Rattata outbreak."
0735,['Ultra Moon'],"Patient by nature, this Pokémon loses control of itself and pounces when it spots its favorite meal—Rattata!"
0735,['Scarlet'],"Once it finds signs of prey, it will patiently stake out the location, waiting until the sun goes down."
0735,['Violet'],Gumshoos specializes in relentlessly tracking down prey. The simple-minded Skwovet doesn’t seem to provide Gumshoos enough challenge.
0736,['Sun'],Its strong jaw enables it to scrape trees and slurp out the sap. It normally lives underground.
0736,['Moon'],They often gather near places frequented by electric Pokémon in order to avoid being attacked by bird Pokémon.
0736,['Ultra Sun'],"If you find its nest, you shouldn’t stick your hand inside. You’ll get bitten by an irritated Grubbin."
0736,['Ultra Moon'],"It spits a sticky thread to stop opponents in their tracks, and then it grabs them in its sharp, sturdy mandibles to take them down."
0736,['Sword'],"Its natural enemies, like Rookidee, may flee rather than risk getting caught in its large mandibles that can snap thick tree branches."
0736,['Shield'],"It uses its big jaws to dig nests into the forest floor, and it loves to feed on sweet tree sap."
0737,['Sun'],"Its body is capable of storing electricity. On camping trips, people are grateful to have one around."
0737,['Moon'],"From the food it digests, it generates electricity, and it stores this energy in its electric sac."
0737,['Ultra Sun'],"It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely moves, munching away on humus. If you accidentally step on one, you’ll get a shock!"
0737,['Ultra Moon'],Its stout shell provides excellent defense from attacks. It uses electricity on persistent opponents.
0737,['Sword'],"While its durable shell protects it from attacks, Charjabug strikes at enemies with jolts of electricity discharged from the tips of its jaws."
0737,['Shield'],Its digestive processes convert the leaves it eats into electricity. An electric sac in its belly stores the electricity for later use.
0738,['Sun'],"It zips around, on sharp lookout for an opening. It concentrates electrical energy within its large jaws and uses it to zap its enemies."
0738,['Moon'],It produces electricity via an electrical organ in its abdomen. It overwhelms bird Pokémon with shocking beams of electrical energy.
0738,['Ultra Sun'],It has an organ that generates electricity in its abdomen. It concentrates energy in its strong jaws and fires off powerful jolts of electricity.
0738,['Ultra Moon'],Vikavolt flusters opponents with acrobatic flying maneuvers. This creates an opening for it to deliver an electric beam attack.
0738,['Sword'],"It builds up electricity in its abdomen, focuses it through its jaws, and then fires the electricity off in concentrated beams."
0738,['Shield'],"If it carries a Charjabug to use as a spare battery, a flying Vikavolt can rapidly fire high-powered beams of electricity."
0739,['Sun'],"While guarding its weak points with its pincers, it looks for an opening and unleashes punches. When it loses, it foams at the mouth and faints."
0739,['Moon'],"It punches so much, its pincers often come off from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What little meat they contain is rich and delicious."
0739,['Ultra Sun'],Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler are like boxing matches.
0739,['Ultra Moon'],Crabrawler has been known to mistake Exeggutor for a coconut tree and climb it. The enraged Exeggutor shakes it off and stomps it.
0739,['Scarlet'],"This Pokémon punches trees and eats the berries that drop down, training itself and getting food at the same time."
0739,['Violet'],"If it loses its pincers, they’ll quickly regrow. The pincers are popular ingredients in paella since their shells produce a tasty soup stock."
0740,['Sun'],"It aimed for the top but got lost and ended up on a snowy mountain. Being forced to endure the cold, this Pokémon evolved and grew fur."
0740,['Moon'],"It just throws punches indiscriminately. In times of desperation, it can lop off its own pincers and fire them like rockets."
0740,['Ultra Sun'],It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its foes. It can even smash thick walls of ice to bits!
0740,['Ultra Moon'],"Before it stops to think, it just starts pummeling. There are records of its turning back avalanches with a flurry of punches."
0740,['Scarlet'],The detached pincers of these Pokémon are delicious. Some Trainers bring Lechonk into the mountains just to search for them.
0740,['Violet'],"Though its punches are powerful, this Pokémon’s movements are sluggish. It blows icy bubbles from its mouth to immobilize its opponents."
0741,['Sun'],"It beats its wings together to create fire. As it moves in the steps of its beautiful dance, it bathes opponents in intense flames."
0741,['Moon'],This Oricorio has sipped red nectar. Its passionate dance moves cause its enemies to combust in both body and mind.
0741,['Ultra Sun'],It wins the hearts of its enemies with its passionate dancing and then uses the opening it creates to burn them up with blazing flames.
0741,['Ultra Moon'],"This Oricorio has drunk red nectar. If its Trainer gives the wrong order, this passionate Pokémon becomes fiercely angry."
0741,['Scarlet'],"This Pokémon is incredibly popular, possibly because its passionate dancing is a great match with the temperament of Paldean people."
0741,['Violet'],This form of Oricorio has sipped red nectar. It whips up blazing flames as it moves to the steps of its passionate dance.
0741,['Sun'],"It beats its wings together to create fire. As it moves in the steps of its beautiful dance, it bathes opponents in intense flames."

0741,['Violet'],This form of Oricorio has sipped red nectar. It whips up blazing flames as it moves to the steps of its passionate dance.
0742,['Sun'],"It feeds on the nectar and pollen of flowers. Because it’s able to sense auras, it can identify which flowers are about to bloom."
0742,['Moon'],Myriads of Cutiefly flutter above the heads of people who have auras resembling those of flowers.
0742,['Ultra Sun'],"Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields of flowers, it gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food."
0742,['Ultra Moon'],Cutiefly can pick up the auras of living things. It skillfully reads those auras to predict its foes’ movements and make fools of them.
0742,['Sword'],"Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. You can find Cutiefly hovering around Gossifleur, trying to get some of Gossifleur’s pollen."
0742,['Shield'],An opponent’s aura can tell Cutiefly what that opponent’s next move will be. Then Cutiefly can glide around the attack and strike back.
0743,['Sun'],"It rolls up pollen into puffs. It makes many different varieties, some used as food and others used in battle."
0743,['Moon'],Some of Ribombee’s pollen puffs are highly nutritious. They are sometimes sold as supplements.
0743,['Ultra Sun'],"Rain makes pollen damp, so Ribombee hates rain. When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a hollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still."
0743,['Ultra Moon'],It can predict the weather from moisture levels and wind direction. Ribombee only reveals itself when there are a few clear days in a row.
0743,['Sword'],It makes pollen puffs from pollen and nectar. The puffs’ effects depend on the type of ingredients and how much of each one is used.
0743,['Shield'],"Ribombee absolutely hate getting wet or rained on. In the cloudy Galar region, they are very seldom seen."
0744,['Sun'],"It’s considered to be a good Pokémon for beginners because of its friendliness, but its disposition grows rougher as it grows up."
0744,['Moon'],This Pokémon has lived with people since times long ago. It can sense when its Trainer is in the dumps and will stick close by its Trainer’s side.
0744,['Ultra Sun'],"As they develop, their disposition grows more violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them too much to handle and abandon them."
0744,['Ultra Moon'],"When it rubs the rocks on its neck against you, that’s proof of its love for you. However, the rocks are sharp, so the gesture is quite painful!"
0744,['Sword'],"This Pokémon can bond very strongly with its Trainer, but it also has a habit of biting. Raising a Rockruff for a long time can be challenging."
0744,['Shield'],"This Pokémon intimidates opponents by striking the ground with the rocks on its neck. The moment an opponent flinches, Rockruff attacks."
0744,['Scarlet'],"This Pokémon is very friendly when it’s young. Its disposition becomes vicious once it matures, but it never forgets the kindness of its master."
0744,['Violet'],"This Pokémon travels in a pack with others until it grows up. When its mood turns sour, it starts striking the ground with the rocks on its neck."

0744,['Violet'],"This Pokémon travels in a pack with others until it grows up. When its mood turns sour, it starts striking the ground with the rocks on its neck."
0745,['Sun'],"Its quick movements confuse its enemies. Well equipped with claws and fangs, it also uses the sharp rocks in its mane as weapons."
0745,['Moon'],"When properly raised from a young age, it will become a trustworthy partner that will absolutely never betray its Trainer."
0745,['Ultra Sun'],The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives. Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees before finishing them off.
0745,['Ultra Moon'],The rocks in its mane are sharper than a knife. Fragments that break off are treasured as good luck charms.
0745,['Sword'],This Lycanroc is calm and cautious. The rocks jutting from its mane are razor sharp.
0745,['Shield'],"With swift movements, this Pokémon gradually backs its prey into a corner. Lycanroc’s fangs are always aimed toward opponents’ weak spots."
0745,['Scarlet'],Lycanroc attacks its prey with its sharp claws and fangs. It loyally obeys the instructions of a Trainer it trusts.
0745,['Violet'],"It has a calm and collected demeanor. It swiftly closes in on its prey, then slices them with the rocks in its mane."
0745,['Sun'],"Its quick movements confuse its enemies. Well equipped with claws and fangs, it also uses the sharp rocks in its mane as weapons."
0745,['Moon'],"When properly raised from a young age, it will become a trustworthy partner that will absolutely never betray its Trainer."

0745,['Violet'],"It has a calm and collected demeanor. It swiftly closes in on its prey, then slices them with the rocks in its mane."
0746,['Sun'],"When it’s in trouble, its eyes moisten and begin to shine. The shining light attracts its comrades, and they stand together against their enemies."
0746,['Moon'],"It’s awfully weak and notably tasty, so everyone is always out to get it. As it happens, anyone trying to bully it receives a painful lesson."
0746,['Ultra Sun'],"They’re weak, so they move in schools. However, they can also often be seen all alone, having strayed from the school."
0746,['Ultra Moon'],"When it’s in a jam, its shining eyes attract others of its kind. The light from its eyes is visible almost 25 miles away."
0746,['Sword'],"Individually, they’re incredibly weak. It’s by gathering up into schools that they’re able to confront opponents."
0746,['Shield'],"When it senses danger, its eyes tear up. The sparkle of its tears signals other Wishiwashi to gather."
0746,['Sun'],"When it’s in trouble, its eyes moisten and begin to shine. The shining light attracts its comrades, and they stand together against their enemies."
0746,['Moon'],"It’s awfully weak and notably tasty, so everyone is always out to get it. As it happens, anyone trying to bully it receives a painful lesson."

0746,['Shield'],"When it senses danger, its eyes tear up. The sparkle of its tears signals other Wishiwashi to gather."
0747,['Sun'],"It plunges the poison spike on its head into its prey. When the prey has weakened, Mareanie deals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles."
0747,['Moon'],It’s found crawling on beaches and seafloors. The coral that grows on Corsola’s head is as good as a five-star banquet to this Pokémon.
0747,['Ultra Sun'],"They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola branches that have naturally fallen off."
0747,['Ultra Moon'],"Aside from its head, its body parts regenerate quickly if they’re cut off. After a good night’s sleep, Mareanie is back to normal."
0747,['Sword'],The first symptom of its sting is numbness. The next is an itching sensation so intense that it’s impossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin.
0747,['Shield'],"Unlike their Alolan counterparts, the Mareanie of the Galar region have not yet figured out that the branches of Corsola are delicious."
0747,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon wanders the seaside looking for food. It often gets electric shocks from broken Pincurchin spines that it tries to eat.
0747,['Violet'],"It has excellent regenerative capabilities. Legs that a Mareanie has lost have a very bitter, astringent flavor—they’re not suitable as food."
0748,['Sun'],Toxapex crawls along the ocean floor on its 12 legs. It leaves a trail of Corsola bits scattered in its wake.
0748,['Moon'],"Those attacked by Toxapex’s poison will suffer intense pain for three days and three nights. Post-recovery, there will be some aftereffects."
0748,['Ultra Sun'],"To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get mown down by the claws on its feet."
0748,['Ultra Moon'],"With its 12 legs, it creates a dome to shelter within. The flow of the tides doesn’t affect Toxapex in there, so it’s very comfortable."
0748,['Sword'],"To survive in the cold waters of Galar, this Pokémon forms a dome with its legs, enclosing its body so it can capture its own body heat."
0748,['Shield'],Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so toxic that Pokémon as large as Wailord will still be suffering three days after it first takes effect.
0748,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon lives within a dome made by its own legs. Toxapex monitors its surroundings by sensing the flow of the tide through its spikes.
0748,['Violet'],"Toxapex gets into fierce battles with Bruxish over areas where warm ocean currents flow, but the odds are always against it."
0749,['Sun'],The mud stuck to Mudbray’s hooves enhances its grip and its powerful running gait.
0749,['Moon'],"It has a stubborn, individualistic disposition. Eating dirt, making mud, and playing in the mire all form part of its daily routine."
0749,['Ultra Sun'],"It loves playing in the mud. If it isn’t showered with mud on a daily basis, it gets stressed out and stops listening to its Trainer."
0749,['Ultra Moon'],"Possessing mighty power, Mudbray can be loaded with 50 times its own body weight and will be totally fine."
0749,['Sword'],Loads weighing up to 50 times as much as its own body weight pose no issue for this Pokémon. It’s skilled at making use of mud.
0749,['Shield'],"It eats dirt to create mud and smears this mud all over its feet, giving them the grip needed to walk on rough terrain without slipping."
0749,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon covers itself in mud that it has regurgitated. The mud won’t dry out even if it’s exposed to the sun for a long time.
0749,['Violet'],"Though a slow walker, Mudbray is plenty strong. Its pace doesn’t change even when it’s loaded with 50 times its own body weight."
0750,['Sun'],"It spits a mud that provides resistance to both wind and rain, so the walls of old houses were often coated with it."
0750,['Moon'],"Its heavy, mud-covered kicks are its best means of attack, and it can reduce large trucks to scrap without breaking a sweat."
0750,['Ultra Sun'],It remains calm and unmoving no matter the situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its mouth to make a special kind of mud.
0750,['Ultra Moon'],"It can trudge mountain roads without rest for three days and three nights, all the while dragging a 10-ton load."
0750,['Sword'],Mud that hardens around a Mudsdale’s legs sets harder than stone. It’s so hard that it allows this Pokémon to scrap a truck with a single kick.
0750,['Shield'],Mudsdale has so much stamina that it could carry over 10 tons across the Galar region without rest or sleep.
0750,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon has been treasured not just for its physical labor but also because it produces high-quality mud used for making pottery.
0750,['Violet'],"Its legs are fortified with mud and harder than stone, and they can reduce a large truck to scrap with one kick."
0751,['Sun'],It crawls onto the land in search of food. Its water bubble allows it to breathe and protects its soft head.
0751,['Moon'],"When it comes across enemies or potential prey, this Pokémon smashes its water-bubble-covered head into them."
0751,['Ultra Sun'],"When two Dewpider meet, they display their water bubbles to each other. Then the one with the smaller bubble gets out of the other’s way."
0751,['Ultra Moon'],"It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in water, so it wears a water bubble on its head when it walks around on land."
0751,['Sword'],It forms a water bubble at the rear of its body and then covers its head with it. Meeting another Dewpider means comparing water-bubble sizes.
0751,['Shield'],"Dewpider normally lives underwater. When it comes onto land in search of food, it takes water with it in the form of a bubble on its head."
0752,['Sun'],"It delivers headbutts with the water bubble on its head. Small Pokémon get sucked into the bubble, where they drown."
0752,['Moon'],"Despite what its appearance suggests, it cares for others. If it finds vulnerable, weak Pokémon, it protectively brings them into its water bubble."
0752,['Ultra Sun'],"It usually passes its time in the water. When its belly is full, it stores its subdued prey in the water bubble on its head."
0752,['Ultra Moon'],"It has a habit of storing things it values in its water bubble. If its Trainer doesn’t watch out, Araquanid will try to put them in its bubble!"
0752,['Sword'],"It launches water bubbles with its legs, drowning prey within the bubbles. This Pokémon can then take its time to savor its meal."
0752,['Shield'],"It acts as a caretaker for Dewpider, putting them inside its bubble and letting them eat any leftover food."
0753,['Sun'],"During the day, it sleeps and soaks up light. When night falls, it walks around looking for a safer place to sleep."
0753,['Moon'],They give off a sweet and refreshing scent. Cutiefly often gather near the tall grass where Fomantis are hiding.
0753,['Ultra Sun'],"When the sun rises, Fomantis spreads its four leaves and bathes in the sunlight. The tip of its head has a pleasant aroma."
0753,['Ultra Moon'],"It loves the sunshine. When it basks in the sunlight regularly, it grows up with vivid coloration."
0753,['Sword'],"When bathed in sunlight, this Pokémon emits a pleasantly sweet scent, which causes bug Pokémon to gather around it."
0753,['Shield'],"During the day, Fomantis basks in sunlight and sleeps peacefully. It wakes and moves around at night."
0753,['Scarlet'],Fomantis hates having its naps interrupted. It fires off beams using energy it gathers by bathing in the sun.
0753,['Violet'],Many Trainers give their Fomantis their own flowerpots so they can sunbathe in peace and quiet.
0754,['Sun'],"It requires a lot of effort to maintain Lurantis’s vivid coloring, but some collectors enjoy this work and treat it as their hobby."
0754,['Moon'],It fires beams from its sickle-shaped petals. These beams are powerful enough to cleave through thick metal plates.
0754,['Ultra Sun'],"For self-protection, it pretends to be a bug Pokémon. Both of its arms bear keen-edged petals."
0754,['Ultra Moon'],"As it slashes into its enemies, it looks like it’s dancing. Its elegant appearance has led some to call it the most glamorous Grass Pokémon."
0754,['Sword'],"This Pokémon resembles a beautiful flower. A properly raised Lurantis will have gorgeous, brilliant colors."
0754,['Shield'],"The petals on this Pokémon’s arms are thin and super sharp, and they can fire laser beams if Lurantis gathers light first."
0754,['Scarlet'],"By masquerading as a bug Pokémon, it lowers the guard of actual bug Pokémon lured in by a scent of sweet flowers. Its sickles bring them down."
0754,['Violet'],A lot of time and effort is required to maintain the vivid colors of its petals. This Pokémon puts its Trainer’s attentiveness to the test.
0755,['Sun'],It scatters spores that flicker and glow. Anyone seeing these lights falls into a deep slumber.
0755,['Moon'],"As it drowses the day away, it nourishes itself by sucking from tree roots. It wakens at the fall of night, wandering off in search of a new tree."
0755,['Ultra Sun'],"It scatters its shining spores around itself. Even though they’re dangerous, nighttime tours of forests where Morelull live are popular."
0755,['Ultra Moon'],"It likes damp dark places. When night falls, the spores filling the caps of its mushrooms glow."
0755,['Sword'],Pokémon living in the forest eat the delicious caps on Morelull’s head. The caps regrow overnight.
0755,['Shield'],Morelull live in forests that stay dark even during the day. They scatter flickering spores that put enemies to sleep.
0756,['Sun'],Forests where Shiinotic live are treacherous to enter at night. People confused by its strange lights can never find their way home again.
0756,['Moon'],"It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness. When its prey succumb to sleep, this Pokémon feeds on them by sucking in their energy."
0756,['Ultra Sun'],"It puts its prey to sleep and siphons off their vitality through the tip of its arms. If one of its kind is weakened, it helps by sending it vitality."
0756,['Ultra Moon'],"When it starts fighting for territory with Parasect, the entire area gets completely coated in spores!"
0756,['Sword'],"Its flickering spores lure in prey and put them to sleep. Once this Pokémon has its prey snoozing, it drains their vitality with its fingertips."
0756,['Shield'],"If you see a light deep in a forest at night, don’t go near. Shiinotic will make you fall fast asleep."
0757,['Sun'],"It burns its bodily fluids to create a poisonous gas. When its enemies become disoriented from inhaling the gas, it attacks them."
0757,['Moon'],"Volcanoes or dry, craggy places are its home. It emanates a sweet-smelling poisonous gas that attracts bug Pokémon, then attacks them."
0757,['Ultra Sun'],"The males will do whatever the females tell them. They give the females most of their food. Due to malnutrition, the males can’t evolve."
0757,['Ultra Moon'],"It weakens opponents and sends them reeling with its poisonous gas. Salandit doesn’t deal well with Spinda, since it’s always reeling."
0757,['Sword'],Its venom sacs produce a fluid that this Pokémon then heats up with the flame in its tail. This process creates Salandit’s poisonous gas.
0757,['Shield'],This sneaky Pokémon will slink behind its prey and immobilize it with poisonous gas before the prey even realizes Salandit is there.
0757,['Scarlet'],"It taunts its prey and lures them into narrow, rocky areas where it then sprays them with toxic gas to make them dizzy and take them down."
0757,['Violet'],Only female Salandit can produce gas laden with pheromones. Males entranced by this gas will do whatever the females tell them.
0758,['Sun'],"For some reason, only females have been found. It creates a reverse harem of male Salandit that it lives with."
0758,['Moon'],"Filled with pheromones, its poisonous gas can be diluted to use in the production of luscious perfumes."
0758,['Ultra Sun'],Salazzle lives deep in caves and forces the Salandit it has attracted with its pheromones to serve it.
0758,['Ultra Moon'],It punishes Salandit that couldn’t bring it food with a fierce slap of its flame-spewing palm.
0758,['Sword'],Only female Salazzle exist. They emit a gas laden with pheromones to captivate male Salandit.
0758,['Shield'],The winner of competitions between Salazzle is decided by which one has the most male Salandit with it.
0758,['Scarlet'],"Salazzle makes its opponents light-headed with poisonous gas, then captivates them with alluring movements to turn them into loyal servants."
0758,['Violet'],"When two Salazzle meet, they will use their pheromone gas to fight over the males in each other’s group."
0759,['Sun'],"Despite its adorable appearance, when it gets angry and flails about, its arms and legs could knock a pro wrestler sprawling."
0759,['Moon'],A touch from anyone except a known friend sends it into a surging frenzy. It’s an incredibly dangerous Pokémon.
0759,['Ultra Sun'],It boasts power enough to split large trees in half. The organ on its rear releases an odor that it uses to communicate with others of its kind.
0759,['Ultra Moon'],"Stufful hates to be hugged or touched in any way. It will squirm, thrash, and resist with amazing power."
0759,['Sword'],"Its fluffy fur is a delight to pet, but carelessly reaching out to touch this Pokémon could result in painful retaliation."
0759,['Shield'],"The way it protects itself by flailing its arms may be an adorable sight, but stay well away. This is flailing that can snap thick tree trunks."
0760,['Sun'],This immensely dangerous Pokémon possesses overwhelming physical strength. Its habitat is generally off-limits.
0760,['Moon'],This Pokémon has the habit of hugging its companions. Many Trainers have left this world after their spines were squashed by its hug.
0760,['Ultra Sun'],It waves its hands wildly in intimidation and warning. Life is over for anyone who doesn’t run away as fast as possible.
0760,['Ultra Moon'],It boasts tremendous physical strength. Many people call it the most dangerous Pokémon in the Alola region.
0760,['Sword'],"Once it accepts you as a friend, it tries to show its affection with a hug. Letting it do that is dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones."
0760,['Shield'],The moves it uses to take down its prey would make a martial artist jealous. It tucks subdued prey under its arms to carry them to its nest.
0761,['Sun'],A delectable aroma pours from its body. They are often swallowed whole by Toucannon lured by that wafting deliciousness.
0761,['Moon'],"Although it’s too sugary for human consumption, Bounsweet’s sweat can be watered down into a juice with just the right amount of sweetness."
0761,['Ultra Sun'],"Because of its sweet, delicious aroma, bird Pokémon are always after it, but it’s not intelligent enough to care."
0761,['Ultra Moon'],It tries to resist being swallowed by a bird Pokémon by spinning the sepals on its head. It’s usually a fruitless attempt.
0761,['Sword'],"Its body gives off a sweet, fruity scent that is extremely appetizing to bird Pokémon."
0761,['Shield'],"When under attack, it secretes a sweet and delicious sweat. The scent only calls more enemies to it."
0761,['Scarlet'],"Its sweat is sweet, like syrup made from boiled-down fruit. Because of this, Bounsweet was highly valued in the past, when sweeteners were scarce."
0761,['Violet'],A Greedent drawn in by the sweet scent of these Pokémon will tuck the Bounsweet in among the berries in its tail and carry them all away.
0762,['Sun'],"The sepals on its head developed to protect its body. These are quite hard, so even if pecked by bird Pokémon, this Pokémon is totally fine."
0762,['Moon'],This Pokémon is always bouncing around energetically. Other Pokémon are attracted by its lively appearance and pleasant aroma.
0762,['Ultra Sun'],"It’s protected by its hard sepals, so it plays with bird Pokémon without worry. They peck it relentlessly, but it doesn’t care."
0762,['Ultra Moon'],"It bounces around, swinging the sepals on its head with abandon. They’re quite painful when they smack you!"
0762,['Sword'],"As it twirls like a dancer, a sweet smell spreads out around it. Anyone who inhales the scent will feel a surge of happiness."
0762,['Shield'],Any Corvisquire that pecks at this Pokémon will be greeted with a smack from its sepals followed by a sharp kick.
0762,['Scarlet'],Steenee spreads a sweet scent that makes others feel invigorated. This same scent is popular for antiperspirants.
0762,['Violet'],"Steenee bounces energetically through forests. If the rind that peels off its body is pulverized, it can be used to treat stomach pains."
0763,['Sun'],"Its long, striking legs aren’t just for show but to be used to kick with skill. In victory, it shows off by kicking the defeated, laughing boisterously."
0763,['Moon'],"A Pokémon known for the beauty of its well-shaped legs, it sometimes appears as a mascot in advertisements for beauty salons."
0763,['Ultra Sun'],"A master of grand and beautiful kicks, it can knock out even kickboxing champions with a single blow."
0763,['Ultra Moon'],"A Pokémon with an aggressive personality and a mastery of kicking, it cackles every time it kicks an opponent."
0763,['Sword'],"This feared Pokémon has long, slender legs and a cruel heart. It shows no mercy as it stomps on its opponents."
0763,['Shield'],A kick from the hardened tips of this Pokémon’s legs leaves a wound in the opponent’s body and soul that will never heal.
0763,['Scarlet'],"This Pokémon is proud and aggressive. However, it is said that a Tsareena will instantly become calm if someone touches the crown on its calyx."
0763,['Violet'],"This Pokémon launches fierce yet elegant kicks with its long, slender legs. It views Quaquaval as its rival."
0764,['Sun'],"It attaches flowers to its highly nutritious vine. This revitalizes the flowers, and they give off an aromatic scent."
0764,['Moon'],"Baths prepared with the flowers from its vine have a relaxing effect, so this Pokémon is a hit with many people."
0764,['Ultra Sun'],"It stretches sticky vines out from its head and picks flowers to adorn itself with. When it doesn’t have any flowers, it feels uneasy."
0764,['Ultra Moon'],It picks flowers and sticks them to its body with fluids it produces. The aroma that wafts from its petals has a healing effect.
0764,['Sword'],"Comfey picks flowers with its vine and decorates itself with them. For some reason, flowers won’t wither once they’re attached to a Comfey."
0764,['Shield'],"These Pokémon smell very nice. All Comfey wear different flowers, so each of these Pokémon has its own individual scent."
0765,['Sun'],"Known for its extreme intelligence, this Pokémon will look down on inexperienced Trainers, so it’s best suited to veteran Trainers."
0765,['Moon'],"Deep in the jungle, high in the lofty canopy, this Pokémon abides. On rare occasions, it shows up at the beach to match wits with Slowking."
0765,['Ultra Sun'],It normally spends its time meditating in the treetops. It throws Poké Balls and gives other Pokémon orders as it pleases.
0765,['Ultra Moon'],"Oranguru don’t get along with each other, so they’re always engaging in battles of wits to decide which one is superior."
0765,['Sword'],With waves of its fan—made from leaves and its own fur—Oranguru skillfully gives instructions to other Pokémon.
0765,['Shield'],"It knows the forest inside and out. If it comes across a wounded Pokémon, Oranguru will gather medicinal herbs to treat it."
0765,['Scarlet'],People used to mistake Oranguru for a human when they saw it issue command after command to the other Pokémon of the forest.
0765,['Violet'],"This Pokémon lives quietly in the depths of the forest. The purple, cape-like fur gets longer and longer as Oranguru ages."
0766,['Sun'],They form groups of roughly 20 individuals. Their mutual bond is remarkable—they will never let down a comrade.
0766,['Moon'],"They battle with hard berries for weapons. Their techniques are passed from the boss to the group, generation upon generation."
0766,['Ultra Sun'],They use their saliva to stick leaves to their shoulders. You can tell what troop they belong to from the position of the leaves.
0766,['Ultra Moon'],Berries are its weapons as well as the staple of its diet. The one that can throw a berry the farthest is the boss of the troop.
0766,['Sword'],"Displaying amazing teamwork, they follow the orders of their boss as they all help out in the search for their favorite berries."
0766,['Shield'],"Passimian live in groups of about 20, with each member performing an assigned role. Through cooperation, the group survives."
0766,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon battles by throwing hard berries. It won’t obey a Trainer who throws Poké Balls without skill.
0766,['Violet'],The boss chooses 10 members of the group to go out hunting. The hunting party will evenly split the food they find with the rest of the group.
0767,['Sun'],"This Pokémon is a coward. As it desperately dashes off, the flailing of its many legs leaves a sparkling clean path in its wake."
0767,['Moon'],"Its habitat varies from beaches to seabeds. A natural scavenger, it will gleefully chow down on anything edible, no matter how rotten."
0767,['Ultra Sun'],"It will pick up anything it finds on the ground. Sometimes it finds coins, so Murkrow and Meowth will go after it."
0767,['Ultra Moon'],"An astonishingly cowardly Pokémon, Wimpod will whir its legs at high speeds to run away if anything comes near it."
0767,['Sword'],"It’s nature’s cleaner—it eats anything and everything, including garbage and rotten things. The ground near its nest is always clean."
0767,['Shield'],"Wimpod gather in swarms, constantly on the lookout for danger. They scatter the moment they detect an enemy’s presence."
0768,['Sun'],"With a flashing slash of its giant sharp claws, it cleaves seawater—or even air—right in two."
0768,['Moon'],"It battles skillfully with its six arms, but spends most of its time peacefully meditating in caves deep beneath the sea."
0768,['Ultra Sun'],The shell covering its body is as hard as diamond. This Pokémon will do anything it takes to win.
0768,['Ultra Moon'],"Its claws, which it can extend and retract at will, are its greatest weapons. Golisopod is sometimes accompanied by Wimpod."
0768,['Sword'],"It will do anything to win, taking advantage of every opening and finishing opponents off with the small claws on its front legs."
0768,['Shield'],"They live in sunken ships or in holes in the seabed. When Golisopod and Grapploct battle, the loser becomes the winner’s meal."
0769,['Sun'],"Born from a sand mound playfully built by a child, this Pokémon embodies the grudges of the departed."
0769,['Moon'],It takes control of anyone who puts a hand in its mouth. And so it adds to the accumulation of its sand-mound body.
0769,['Ultra Sun'],"It likes the shovel on its head, so Sandygast will get serious and fight any children who come to take it back."
0769,['Ultra Moon'],"If you build sand mounds when you’re playing, destroy them before you go home, or they may get possessed and become Sandygast."
0769,['Sword'],Grudges of the dead have possessed a mound of sand and become a Pokémon. Sandygast is fond of the shovel on its head.
0769,['Shield'],"Sandygast mainly inhabits beaches. It takes control of anyone who puts their hand into its mouth, forcing them to make its body bigger."
0769,['Scarlet'],"If it loses its shovel, it will stick something else—like a branch—in its head to make do until it finds another shovel."
0769,['Violet'],"It flings sand into the eyes of its prey and tries to close in on them while they’re blinded, but since Sandygast is so slow, the prey tends to escape."
0770,['Sun'],"Possessed people controlled by this Pokémon transformed its sand mound into a castle. As it evolved, its power to curse grew ever stronger."
0770,['Moon'],Buried beneath the castle are masses of dried-up bones from those whose vitality it has drained.
0770,['Ultra Sun'],Each of its grains of sand has its own will. Palossand eats small Pokémon and siphons away their vital essence while they’re still alive.
0770,['Ultra Moon'],"Once it has whipped up a sandstorm to halt its opponents in their tracks, this terrifying Pokémon snatches away their vitality."
0770,['Sword'],"Palossand is known as the Beach Nightmare. It pulls its prey down into the sand by controlling the sand itself, and then it sucks out their souls."
0770,['Shield'],"This Pokémon lives on beaches, but it hates water. Palossand can’t maintain its castle-like shape if it gets drenched by a heavy rain."
0770,['Scarlet'],"The terrifying Palossand drags smaller Pokémon into its sandy body. Once its victims are trapped, it drains them of their vitality whenever it pleases."
0770,['Violet'],"From the hollows in its arms, it fires the bones of its victims, which are all dried up after being drained of their vitality."
0771,['Sun'],"It lives in shallow seas, such as areas near a beach. It can eject its internal organs, which it uses to engulf its prey or battle enemies."
0771,['Moon'],These Pokémon line the beaches. The sticky mucous that covers their bodies can be used to soothe sunburned skin. How convenient!
0771,['Ultra Sun'],The tradition known as Pyukumuku chucking started from the custom of throwing Pyukumuku back into the sea after they wash onshore.
0771,['Ultra Moon'],"Its entire body is covered in its own slime. If you accidentally step on one, you’ll slip, and it will get mad and smack you!"
0771,['Sword'],"It lives in warm, shallow waters. If it encounters a foe, it will spit out its internal organs as a means to punch them."
0771,['Shield'],"It’s covered in a slime that keeps its skin moist, allowing it to stay on land for days without drying up."
0772,['Sun'],The heavy control mask it wears suppresses its intrinsic capabilities. This Pokémon has some hidden special power.
0772,['Moon'],"Due to the danger that this synthetic Pokémon may go on a rampage, it wears a control mask to restrain its power."
0772,['Ultra Sun'],"A Pokémon weapon developed for a specific mission, it went berserk during an experiment, so it was cryogenically frozen."
0772,['Ultra Moon'],"There’s danger of its going on a rampage, so its true power is sealed away beneath its control mask."
0772,['Sword'],Rumor has it that the theft of top-secret research notes led to a new instance of this Pokémon being created in the Galar region.
0772,['Shield'],It was modeled after a mighty Pokémon of myth. The mask placed upon it limits its power in order to keep it under control.
0773,['Sun'],"Its trust in its partner is what awakens it. This Pokémon is capable of changing its type, a flexibility that is well displayed in battle."
0773,['Moon'],"Although its name was Type: Null at first, the boy who evolved it into this form gave it the name by which it is now known."
0773,['Ultra Sun'],"This is its form once it has awakened and evolved. Freed from its heavy mask, its speed is greatly increased."
0773,['Ultra Moon'],"Through the bond it formed with its Trainer, its will was strengthened, and it was able to destroy its control mask."
0773,['Sword'],A solid bond of trust between this Pokémon and its Trainer awakened the strength hidden within Silvally. It can change its type at will.
0773,['Shield'],The final factor needed to release this Pokémon’s true power was a strong bond with a Trainer it trusts.
0774,['Sun'],"Originally making its home in the ozone layer, it hurtles to the ground when the shell enclosing its body grows too heavy."
0774,['Moon'],Strong impacts can knock it out of its shell. This Pokémon was born from mutated nanoparticles.
0774,['Ultra Sun'],"It lives in the ozone layer, where it becomes food for stronger Pokémon. When it tries to run away, it falls to the ground."
0774,['Ultra Moon'],"Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable, the shock of falling to the ground smashes the shell to smithereens."
0774,['Sun'],"Originally making its home in the ozone layer, it hurtles to the ground when the shell enclosing its body grows too heavy."
0774,['Moon'],Strong impacts can knock it out of its shell. This Pokémon was born from mutated nanoparticles.
0774,['Ultra Sun'],"It lives in the ozone layer, where it becomes food for stronger Pokémon. When it tries to run away, it falls to the ground."
0774,['Ultra Moon'],"Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable, the shock of falling to the ground smashes the shell to smithereens."
0775,['Sun'],"It is born asleep, and it dies asleep. All its movements are apparently no more than the results of it tossing and turning in its dreams."
0775,['Moon'],The log it holds was given to it by its parents at birth. It has also been known to cling to the arm of a friendly Trainer.
0775,['Ultra Sun'],"It stays asleep from the moment it’s born. When it falls into a deep sleep, it stops moving altogether."
0775,['Ultra Moon'],It remains asleep from birth to death as a result of the sedative properties of the leaves that form its diet.
0775,['Scarlet'],Komala spends its entire life sleeping. It feeds on leaves that contain a potent poison only Komala can break down.
0775,['Violet'],A potent anesthetic can be made by diluting Komala’s drool. This anesthetic was used for surgeries in the past.
0776,['Sun'],The shell on its back is chemically unstable and explodes violently if struck. The hole in its stomach is its weak point.
0776,['Moon'],It gushes fire and poisonous gases from its nostrils. Its dung is an explosive substance and can be put to various uses.
0776,['Ultra Sun'],It lives in volcanoes and eats sulfur and other minerals. Materials from the food it eats form the basis of its explosive shell.
0776,['Ultra Moon'],"Its exploding shell poses a real danger but is sensitive to moisture. On rainy days, Turtonator takes silent refuge in caves."
0776,['Sword'],Explosive substances coat the shell on its back. Enemies that dare attack it will be blown away by an immense detonation.
0776,['Shield'],Eating sulfur in its volcanic habitat is what causes explosive compounds to develop in its shell. Its droppings are also dangerously explosive.
0777,['Sun'],"The spiny fur on its back is normally at rest. When this Pokémon becomes agitated, its fur stands on end and stabs into its attackers."
0777,['Moon'],The long hairs on its back act as lightning rods. The bolts of lightning it attracts are stored as energy in its electric sac.
0777,['Ultra Sun'],"When it’s surprised or agitated, the 14 fur spikes on its back will stand up involuntarily."
0777,['Ultra Moon'],"Its capacity to produce electricity is somewhat limited, so it gets charged up by letting lightning strike it!"
0777,['Sword'],"With the long hairs on its back, this Pokémon takes in electricity from other electric Pokémon. It stores what it absorbs in an electric sac."
0777,['Shield'],"When it’s in trouble, it curls up into a ball, makes its fur spikes stand on end, and then discharges electricity indiscriminately."
0778,['Sun'],"After going to all the effort of disguising itself, its neck was broken. Whatever is inside is probably unharmed, but it’s still feeling sad."
0778,['Moon'],"If its neck is broken or its rag torn during an attack, it works through the night to patch it."
0778,['Ultra Sun'],"It stands in front of a mirror, trying to fix its broken neck as if its life depended on it. It has a hard time getting it right, so it’s crying inside."
0778,['Ultra Moon'],"Sad that its true identity may be exposed, Mimikyu will mercilessly seek revenge on any opponent that breaks its neck."
0778,['Sword'],"There will be no forgiveness for any who reveal that it was pretending to be Pikachu. It will bring the culprit down, even at the cost of its own life."
0778,['Shield'],"Its disguise made from an old rag allowed it to avoid an attack, but the impact broke the neck of the disguise. Now everyone knows it’s a Mimikyu."
0778,['Scarlet'],"Even as it struggles beneath the cloth to repair the broken neck of its disguise, Mimikyu keeps up its impersonation of Pikachu."
0778,['Violet'],"It has taken damage and can no longer hold the head of its cloth disguise upright. For as long as it lives, Mimikyu will never forget its attacker."
0779,['Sun'],"When it unleashes its psychic power from the protuberance on its head, the grating sound of grinding teeth echoes through the area."
0779,['Moon'],It stuns its prey with psychokinesis and then grinds them to mush with its strong teeth. Even Shellder’s shell is no match for it.
0779,['Ultra Sun'],"It burrows beneath the sand, radiating psychic power from the protuberance on its head. It waits for prey as it surveys the area."
0779,['Ultra Moon'],"Its skin is thick enough to fend off Mareanie’s spikes. With its robust teeth, Bruxish crunches up the spikes and eats them."
0779,['Scarlet'],It grinds its teeth with great force to stimulate its brain. It fires the psychic energy created by this process from the protuberance on its head.
0779,['Violet'],"When sunlight reflects on the ripples created by a Bruxish grinding its teeth, the water all around sparkles brilliantly."
0780,['Sun'],"It has a compassionate personality, but if it is angered, it completely destroys its surroundings with its intense breath."
0780,['Moon'],This Pokémon is friendly to people and loves children most of all. It comes from deep in the mountains to play with children it likes in town.
0780,['Ultra Sun'],"If a child it has made friends with is bullied, Drampa will find the bully’s house and burn it to the ground."
0780,['Ultra Moon'],"It appears in towns and plays with the children. Drampa will protect kids when they’re in danger, so their moms don’t have to worry."
0780,['Sword'],"The mountains it calls home are nearly two miles in height. On rare occasions, it descends to play with the children living in the towns below."
0780,['Shield'],"Drampa is a kind and friendly Pokémon—up until it’s angered. When that happens, it stirs up a gale and flattens everything around."
0781,['Sun'],"Swinging its massive anchor, it can KO Wailord in a single blow. What appears to be green seaweed is actually its body."
0781,['Moon'],The soul of seaweed adrift in the waves became reborn as this Pokémon. It maintains itself with new infusions of seabed detritus and seaweed.
0781,['Ultra Sun'],It wraps its prey in green seaweed and sucks away their vitality. It only likes to go after big prey like Wailord.
0781,['Ultra Moon'],"Its chain-like green seaweed can stretch outward for hundreds of yards. For some reason, it gets along well with Skrelp."
0781,['Sword'],"After a piece of seaweed merged with debris from a sunken ship, it was reborn as this ghost Pokémon."
0781,['Shield'],"After lowering its anchor, it waits for its prey. It catches large Wailord and drains their life-force."
0782,['Sun'],It expresses its feelings by smacking its scales. Metallic sounds echo through the tall mountains where Jangmo-o lives.
0782,['Moon'],They live in mountains where no trace of humans can be detected. Jangmo-o grow little by little as they battle one another.
0782,['Ultra Sun'],It smacks the scales on its head against rocks or against the ground to frighten its opponents. It can also contact its friends with these noises.
0782,['Ultra Moon'],It will never show an enemy its back in battle. Ancient warriors liked Jangmo-o for its valiant disposition and made it one of their own.
0782,['Sword'],They learn to fight by smashing their head scales together. The dueling strengthens both their skills and their spirits.
0782,['Shield'],Jangmo-o strikes its scales to communicate with others of its kind. Its scales are actually fur that’s become as hard as metal.
0783,['Sun'],It leaps at its prey with a courageous shout. Its scaly punches tear its opponents to shreds.
0783,['Moon'],It sheds and regrows its scales on a continuous basis. The scales become harder and sharper each time they’re regrown.
0783,['Ultra Sun'],"It makes noise by clanging its scales together. When the rhythm has reached its peak, Hakamo-o attacks."
0783,['Ultra Moon'],"The scales it sheds can be molded and processed to make pots and pans. They conduct heat well, so they’re a popular item."
0783,['Sword'],"The scaleless, scarred parts of its body are signs of its strength. It shows them off to defeated opponents."
0783,['Shield'],"Before attacking its enemies, it clashes its scales together and roars. Its sharp claws shred the opposition."
0784,['Sun'],"When it spots enemies, it threatens them by jingling the scales on its tail. Weak opponents will crack and flee in panic."
0784,['Moon'],"Its rigid scales function as offense and defense. In the past, its scales were processed and used to make weapons and other commodities."
0784,['Ultra Sun'],"When it howls after finishing off its prey, the metallic sounds of its celebrating comrades can be heard from all around."
0784,['Ultra Moon'],"It battles valiantly with its fists, which are armored in steel scales. Kommo-o specializes in uppercuts."
0784,['Sword'],It clatters its tail scales to unnerve opponents. This Pokémon will battle only those who stand steadfast in the face of this display.
0784,['Shield'],Certain ruins have paintings of ancient warriors wearing armor made of Kommo-o scales.
0785,['Sun'],This guardian deity of Melemele is brimming with curiosity. It summons thunderclouds and stores their lightning inside its body.
0785,['Moon'],It confuses its enemies by flying too quickly for the eye to follow. It has a hair-trigger temper but forgets what made it angry an instant later.
0785,['Ultra Sun'],"Although it’s called a guardian deity, if a person or Pokémon puts it in a bad mood, it will become a malevolent deity and attack."
0785,['Ultra Moon'],"The lightning-wielding guardian deity of Melemele, Tapu Koko is brimming with curiosity and appears before people from time to time."
0786,['Sun'],This guardian deity of Akala is guilelessly cruel. The fragrant aroma of flowers is the source of its energy.
0786,['Moon'],"As it flutters about, it scatters its strangely glowing scales. Touching them is said to restore good health on the spot."
0786,['Ultra Sun'],It heals the wounds of people and Pokémon by sprinkling them with its sparkling scales. This guardian deity is worshiped on Akala.
0786,['Ultra Moon'],"Although called a guardian deity, Tapu Lele is devoid of guilt about its cruel disposition and can be described as nature incarnate."
0787,['Sun'],"It pulls large trees up by the roots and swings them around. It causes vegetation to grow, and then it absorbs energy from the growth."
0787,['Moon'],The guardian deity of Ula’ula is a lazy Pokémon. It commands plants to immobilize its foes and then deals them a savage blow with its horns.
0787,['Ultra Sun'],"Although it’s called a guardian deity, it’s violent enough to crush anyone it sees as an enemy."
0787,['Ultra Moon'],"It makes ringing sounds with its tail to let others know where it is, avoiding unneeded conflicts. This guardian deity of Ula’ula controls plants."
0788,['Sun'],The dense fog it creates brings the downfall and destruction of its confused enemies. Ocean currents are the source of its energy.
0788,['Moon'],"The guardian deity of Poni, it can control water. People say it can create pure water that will wash away any uncleanness."
0788,['Ultra Sun'],"This guardian deity of Poni Island manipulates water. Because it lives deep within a thick fog, it came to be both feared and revered."
0788,['Ultra Moon'],"Although it’s called a guardian deity, terrible calamities sometimes befall those who recklessly approach Tapu Fini."
0789,['Sun'],Its body is gaseous and frail. It slowly grows as it collects dust from the atmosphere.
0789,['Moon'],"In ages past, it was called the child of the stars. It’s said to be a Pokémon from another world, but no specific details are known."
0789,['Ultra Sun'],"Even though its helpless, gaseous body can be blown away by the slightest breeze, it doesn’t seem to care."
0789,['Ultra Moon'],"Whether or not it’s a Pokémon from this world is a mystery. When it’s in a jam, it warps away to a safe place to hide."
0789,['Sword'],This Pokémon came from another universe. Its gaseous body is so light that even a gentle breeze can blow it away.
0789,['Shield'],"Cosmog is very curious but not very cautious, often placing itself in danger. If things start to look dicey, it teleports away."
0790,['Sun'],"Motionless as if dead, its body is faintly warm to the touch. In the distant past, it was called the cocoon of the stars."

0790,['Ultra Moon'],"As it absorbs light, Cosmoem continues to grow. Its golden shell is surprisingly solid."

0791,['Moon'],"This Pokémon is said to be a male evolution of Cosmog. At the activation of its third eye, it departs for another world."
0791,['Ultra Sun'],Sometimes the result of its opening an Ultra Wormhole is that energy and life-forms from other worlds are called here to this world.
0791,['Ultra Moon'],"In writings from the distant past, it’s called by the name “the beast that devours the sun.”"
0791,['Sword'],"When light radiates from its body, this Pokémon could almost appear to be the sun. It will dispel any darkness and light up the world."
0791,['Shield'],Solgaleo was once known as the Beast That Devours the Sun. Energy in the form of light radiates boundlessly from it.
0792,['Sun'],"It is said to be a female evolution of Cosmog. When its third eye activates, away it flies to another world."
0792,['Moon'],"Said to live in another world, this Pokémon devours light, drawing the moonless dark veil of night over the brightness of day."
0792,['Ultra Sun'],"Records of it exist in writings from long, long ago, where it was known by the name “the beast that calls the moon.”"
0792,['Ultra Moon'],It sometimes summons unknown powers and life-forms here to this world from holes that lead to other worlds.
0792,['Sword'],"Known as the Beast That Calls the Moon, this Pokémon lives by taking in any and all light and converting it into its own energy."
0792,['Shield'],"It steals the light from its surroundings and then becomes the full moon, showering its own light across the night sky."
0793,['Sun'],One of several mysterious Ultra Beasts. People on the street report observing those infested by it suddenly becoming violent.

0793,['Ultra Sun'],"A life-form from another world, it was dubbed a UB and is thought to produce a strong neurotoxin."
0793,['Ultra Moon'],It appeared in this world from an Ultra Wormhole. Nihilego appears to be a parasite that lives by feeding on people and Pokémon.
0794,['Sun'],"This Ultra Beast appeared from another world. It shows off its body, but whether that display is a boast or a threat remains unclear."
0794,['Moon'],A mysterious life-form called an Ultra Beast. Witnesses saw it pulverize a dump truck with a single punch.
0794,['Ultra Sun'],"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger here, it’s apparently a common organism in the world where it normally lives."

0795,['Sun'],"One of the dangerous Ultra Beasts, it has been spotted running across the land at terrific speeds."
0795,['Moon'],"One of the Ultra Beasts. It refuses to touch anything, perhaps because it senses some uncleanness in this world."

0795,['Ultra Moon'],"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger here, it’s apparently a common organism in the world where it normally lives."
0796,['Sun'],"One of the mysterious life-forms known as Ultra Beasts. Astonishing electric shocks emanate from its entire body, according to witnesses."

0797,['Ultra Moon'],"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger here, it’s apparently a common organism in the world where it normally lives."
0798,['Sun'],"This Ultra Beast came from the Ultra Wormhole. It seems not to attack enemies on its own, but its sharp body is a dangerous weapon in itself."
0798,['Moon'],"One of the Ultra Beast life-forms, it was observed cutting down a gigantic steel tower with one stroke of its blade."
0798,['Ultra Sun'],"This Ultra Beast’s body, which is as thin as paper, is like a sharpened sword."

0800,['Sun'],"Reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts, this life-form, apparently asleep underground, is thought to have come from another world in ancient times."
0800,['Moon'],Light is apparently the source of its energy. It has an extraordinarily vicious disposition and is constantly firing off laser beams.
0800,['Ultra Sun'],"It looks somehow pained as it rages around in search of light, which serves as its energy. It’s apparently from another world."
0800,['Ultra Moon'],"Light is the source of its energy. If it isn’t devouring light, impurities build up in it and on it, and Necrozma darkens and stops moving."
0800,['Sword'],"It survives by absorbing light. After a long time spent slumbering underground, impurities accumulated within it, causing its body to darken."
0800,['Shield'],"It needs light to survive, and it goes on a rampage seeking it out. Its laser beams will cut anything to pieces."
0800,['Sun'],"Reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts, this life-form, apparently asleep underground, is thought to have come from another world in ancient times."

0801,['Sun'],"This artificial Pokémon, constructed more than 500 years ago, can understand human speech but cannot itself speak."
0801,['Moon'],"Its mechanized body is merely a vessel. Its true self is its Soul-Heart, an artificial soul."
0801,['Ultra Sun'],It synchronizes its consciousness with others to understand their feelings. This faculty makes it useful for taking care of people.
0801,['Ultra Moon'],"Built roughly 500 years ago by a scientist, the part called the Soul-Heart is the actual life-form."
0802,['Sun'],"Able to conceal itself in shadows, it never appears before humans, so its very existence was the stuff of myth."
0802,['Moon'],"It lurks in the shadows of others, copying their movements and powers. This Pokémon is craven and cowering."
0802,['Ultra Sun'],"It slips into the shadows of others and mimics their powers and movements. As it improves, it becomes stronger than those it’s imitating."
0802,['Ultra Moon'],"It sinks into the shadows of people and Pokémon, where it can understand their feelings and copy their capabilities."
0802,['Sword'],"By slipping into the shadow of a martial arts master and copying their movements, this Pokémon learned the ultimate techniques."
0802,['Shield'],"This Pokémon can conceal itself in any shadow, so it went undiscovered for a long time."
0803,['Ultra Sun'],This Ultra Beast is well enough liked to be chosen as a first partner in its own world.
0803,['Ultra Moon'],"An Ultra Beast that lives in a different world, it cackles wildly as it sprays its opponents with poison from the needles on its head."
0804,['Ultra Sun'],It stores hundreds of liters of poisonous liquid inside its body. It is one of the organisms known as UBs.
0804,['Ultra Moon'],"One kind of Ultra Beast, it fires a glowing, venomous liquid from its needles. This liquid is also immensely adhesive."
0805,['Ultra Sun'],It appeared from an Ultra Wormhole. Each one appears to be made up of many life-forms stacked one on top of each other.
0805,['Ultra Moon'],"When stone walls started moving and attacking, the brute’s true identity was this mysterious life-form, which brings to mind an Ultra Beast."
0806,['Ultra Sun'],"It slithers toward people. Then, without warning, it triggers the explosion of its own head. It’s apparently one kind of Ultra Beast."
0806,['Ultra Moon'],"A UB that appeared from an Ultra Wormhole, it causes explosions, then takes advantage of opponents’ surprise to rob them of their vitality."
0807,['Ultra Sun'],"It electrifies its claws and tears its opponents apart with them. Even if they dodge its attack, they’ll be electrocuted by the flying sparks."
0807,['Ultra Moon'],"It approaches its enemies at the speed of lightning, then tears them limb from limb with its sharp claws."
0807,['Sword'],"It runs as fast as lightning strikes, shredding its opponents with its high-voltage claws."
0807,['Shield'],"Electricity sparks from the pads on its limbs. Wherever Zeraora runs, lightning flashes and thunder echoes."
0808,"[""Let's Go Pikachu"", ""Let's Go Eevee""]","It melts particles of iron and other metals found in the subsoil, so it can absorb them into its body of molten steel."
0808,['Sword'],It dissolves and eats metal. Circulating liquid metal within its body is how it generates energy.
0808,['Shield'],"They live as a group, but when the time comes, one strong Meltan will absorb all the others and evolve."
0809,"[""Let's Go Pikachu"", ""Let's Go Eevee""]","Revered long ago for its capacity to create iron from nothing, for some reason it has come back to life after 3,000 years."
0809,['Sword'],"At the end of its life-span, Melmetal will rust and fall apart. The small shards left behind will eventually be reborn as Meltan."
0809,['Shield'],Centrifugal force is behind the punches of Melmetal’s heavy hex-nut arms. Melmetal is said to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon.
0810,['Sword'],"When it uses its special stick to strike up a beat, the sound waves produced carry revitalizing energy to the plants and flowers in the area."
0810,['Shield'],"It attacks with rapid beats of its stick. As it strikes with amazing speed, it gets more and more pumped."
0811,['Sword'],"The faster a Thwackey can beat out a rhythm with its two sticks, the more respect it wins from its peers."
0811,['Shield'],"When it’s drumming out rapid beats in battle, it gets so caught up in the rhythm that it won’t even notice that it’s already knocked out its opponent."
0812,['Sword'],"By drumming, it taps into the power of its special tree stump. The roots of the stump follow its direction in battle."
0812,['Shield'],The one with the best drumming techniques becomes the boss of the troop. It has a gentle disposition and values harmony among its group.
0813,['Sword'],"A warm-up of running around gets fire energy coursing through this Pokémon’s body. Once that happens, it’s ready to fight at full power."
0813,['Shield'],"It has special pads on the backs of its feet, and one on its nose. Once it’s raring to fight, these pads radiate tremendous heat."
0814,['Sword'],Its thick and fluffy fur protects it from the cold and enables it to use hotter fire moves.
0814,['Shield'],"It kicks berries right off the branches of trees and then juggles them with its feet, practicing its footwork."
0815,['Sword'],"It juggles a pebble with its feet, turning it into a burning soccer ball. Its shots strike opponents hard and leave them scorched."
0815,['Shield'],"It’s skilled at both offense and defense, and it gets pumped up when cheered on. But if it starts showboating, it could put itself in a tough spot."
0816,['Sword'],"When scared, this Pokémon cries. Its tears pack the chemical punch of 100 onions, and attackers won’t be able to resist weeping."
0816,['Shield'],"When it gets wet, its skin changes color, and this Pokémon becomes invisible as if it were camouflaged."
0817,['Sword'],"A clever combatant, this Pokémon battles using water balloons created with moisture secreted from its palms."
0817,['Shield'],"Highly intelligent but also very lazy, it keeps enemies out of its territory by laying traps everywhere."
0818,['Sword'],"It has many hidden capabilities, such as fingertips that can shoot water and a membrane on its back that it can use to glide through the air."
0818,['Shield'],Its nictitating membranes let it pick out foes’ weak points so it can precisely blast them with water that shoots from its fingertips at Mach 3.
0819,['Sword'],"Found throughout the Galar region, this Pokémon becomes uneasy if its cheeks are ever completely empty of berries."
0819,['Shield'],"It eats berries nonstop—a habit that has made it more resilient than it looks. It’ll show up on farms, searching for yet more berries."
0819,['Scarlet'],"It stores berries in its cheeks. When there are no berries to be found, Skwovet will stuff pebbles into its cheeks to stave off its cravings."
0819,['Violet'],"No matter how much it stuffs its belly with food, it is always anxious about getting hungry again. So, it stashes berries in its cheeks and tail."
0820,['Sword'],"It stashes berries in its tail—so many berries that they fall out constantly. But this Pokémon is a bit slow-witted, so it doesn’t notice the loss."
0820,['Shield'],"Common throughout the Galar region, this Pokémon has strong teeth and can chew through the toughest of berry shells."
0820,['Scarlet'],"If it spots a berry tree, it will immediately go to gather berries without a sideways glance—even if it’s in the middle of a battle."
0820,['Violet'],"This Pokémon makes off with heaps of fallen berries by wrapping them in its tail, which is roughly twice the length of its body."
0821,['Sword'],"It will bravely challenge any opponent, no matter how powerful. This Pokémon benefits from every battle—even a defeat increases its strength a bit."
0821,['Shield'],"Jumping nimbly about, this small-bodied Pokémon takes advantage of even the slightest opportunity to disorient larger opponents."
0821,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon is brave and reckless. The white markings around a Rookidee’s eyes intimidate fainthearted Pokémon.
0821,['Violet'],"The females are fussier than the males. If another creature dirties a female Rookidee’s wings, it’ll peck the offender relentlessly in a burning rage."
0822,['Sword'],"Smart enough to use tools in battle, these Pokémon have been seen picking up rocks and flinging them or using ropes to wrap up enemies."
0822,['Shield'],The lessons of many harsh battles have taught it how to accurately judge an opponent’s strength.
0822,['Scarlet'],It’s said that the reason behind Corvisquire’s high level of intelligence is the large size of its brain relative to those of other bird Pokémon.
0822,['Violet'],This intelligent Pokémon will quickly learn how to use any tool it can hold in its beak or its talons.
0823,['Sword'],This Pokémon reigns supreme in the skies of the Galar region. The black luster of its steel body could drive terror into the heart of any foe.
0823,['Shield'],"With their great intellect and flying skills, these Pokémon very successfully act as the Galar region’s airborne taxi service."
0823,['Scarlet'],"Corviknight can’t serve as a taxi service in Paldea because the Pokémon’s natural predators will attack it while it flies, endangering the customer."
0823,['Violet'],"Although its wings have partly turned to steel and become heavy as a result, this Pokémon flies through the skies with ease."
0824,['Sword'],"A constant collector of information, this Pokémon is very smart. Very strong is what it isn’t."
0824,['Shield'],"Often found in gardens, this Pokémon has hairs on its body that it uses to assess its surroundings."
0825,['Sword'],"It barely moves, but it’s still alive. Hiding in its shell without food or water seems to have awakened its psychic powers."
0825,['Shield'],"As it grows inside its shell, it uses its psychic abilities to monitor the outside world and prepare for evolution."
0826,['Sword'],"It’s famous for its high level of intelligence, and the large size of its brain is proof that it also possesses immense psychic power."
0826,['Shield'],It emits psychic energy to observe and study what’s around it—and what’s around it can include things over six miles away.
0827,['Sword'],"Aided by the soft pads on its feet, it silently raids the food stores of other Pokémon. It survives off its ill-gotten gains."
0827,['Shield'],"Cunning and cautious, this Pokémon survives by stealing food from others. It erases its tracks with swipes of its tail as it makes off with its plunder."
0828,['Sword'],"It secretly marks potential targets with a scent. By following the scent, it stalks its targets and steals from them when they least expect it."
0828,['Shield'],"With a lithe body and sharp claws, it goes around stealing food and eggs. Boltund is its natural enemy."
0829,['Sword'],"It anchors itself in the ground with its single leg, then basks in the sun. After absorbing enough sunlight, its petals spread as it blooms brilliantly."
0829,['Shield'],It whirls around in the wind while singing a joyous song. This delightful display has charmed many into raising this Pokémon.
0830,['Sword'],The seeds attached to its cotton fluff are full of nutrients. It spreads them on the wind so that plants and other Pokémon can benefit from them.
0830,['Shield'],"The cotton on the head of this Pokémon can be spun into a glossy, gorgeous yarn—a Galar regional specialty."
0831,['Sword'],"Its curly fleece is such an effective cushion that this Pokémon could fall off a cliff and stand right back up at the bottom, unharmed."
0831,['Shield'],"If its fleece grows too long, Wooloo won’t be able to move. Cloth made with the wool of this Pokémon is surprisingly strong."
0832,['Sword'],"Weave a carpet from its springy wool, and you end up with something closer to a trampoline. You’ll start to bounce the moment you set foot on it."
0832,['Shield'],Its majestic horns are meant only to impress the opposite gender. They never see use in battle.
0833,['Sword'],Apparently the itch of its teething impels it to snap its jaws at anything in front of it.
0833,['Shield'],"It starts off battles by attacking with its rock-hard horn, but as soon as the opponent flinches, this Pokémon bites down and never lets go."
0833,['Scarlet'],"Its large front tooth is still growing in. When the tooth itches, this Pokémon will bite another Chewtle’s horn, and the two Pokémon will tussle."
0833,['Violet'],A popular game among children is to lift up sticks that Chewtle have bitten onto to see whose Chewtle can hang on the longest.
0834,['Sword'],"With jaws that can shear through steel rods, this highly aggressive Pokémon chomps down on its unfortunate prey."
0834,['Shield'],This Pokémon rapidly extends its retractable neck to sink its sharp fangs into distant enemies and take them down.
0834,['Scarlet'],"Its massive, jagged teeth can crush a boulder in a single bite. This Pokémon has an extremely vicious disposition."
0834,['Violet'],"Drednaw lurks along the shoreline. When prey come to drink water, Drednaw stretches its neck out and chomps down on them."
0835,['Sword'],"This Pokémon is very popular as a herding dog in the Galar region. As it runs, it generates electricity from the base of its tail."
0835,['Shield'],"This gluttonous Pokémon only assists people with their work because it wants treats. As it runs, it crackles with electricity."
0836,['Sword'],This Pokémon generates electricity and channels it into its legs to keep them going strong. Boltund can run nonstop for three full days.
0836,['Shield'],"It sends electricity through its legs to boost their strength. Running at top speed, it easily breaks 50 mph."
0837,['Sword'],"Most of its body has the same composition as coal. Fittingly, this Pokémon was first discovered in coal mines about 400 years ago."
0837,['Shield'],"It can race around like a unicycle, even on rough, rocky terrain. Burning coal sustains it."
0837,['Scarlet'],"On sunny days, Rolycoly will come out onto grassy plains and roll around. Then it will eat the grass that gets tangled in its wheel-like leg."
0837,['Violet'],Chunks of the surface of this Pokémon’s body that have grown old and flaked off have long been used for fuel as an alternative to coal.
0838,['Sword'],It forms coal inside its body. Coal dropped by this Pokémon once helped fuel the lives of people in the Galar region.
0838,['Shield'],"By rapidly rolling its legs, it can travel at over 18 mph. The temperature of the flames it breathes exceeds 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit."
0838,['Scarlet'],The temperature inside its body increases when it experiences strong emotions. It rolls around frantically while spewing flames.
0838,['Violet'],"Due to the coal tar created inside it, the heap of coal on Carkol’s back never falls apart, even when the Pokémon rolls around at high speeds."
0839,['Sword'],"It’s usually peaceful, but the vandalism of mines enrages it. Offenders will be incinerated with flames that reach 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit."
0839,['Shield'],"While it’s engaged in battle, its mountain of coal will burn bright red, sending off sparks that scorch the surrounding area."
0839,['Scarlet'],"To intimidate its opponents, Coalossal will vigorously shake its body, scattering coal from its smoldering back."
0839,['Violet'],"It’s gentle usually but fearsome when angered. With a body that burns at over 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, it crushes foes and turns them to ash."
0840,['Sword'],"It spends its entire life inside an apple. It hides from its natural enemies, bird Pokémon, by pretending it’s just an apple and nothing more."
0840,['Shield'],"As soon as it’s born, it burrows into an apple. Not only does the apple serve as its food source, but the flavor of the fruit determines its evolution."
0840,['Scarlet'],It grows by eating the flesh of an apple. Applin uses its own body fluid to strengthen the apple’s skin and prevent it from rotting.
0840,['Violet'],"Applin lives inside an apple. When an Applin is separated from its apple, its body loses moisture and the Pokémon grows weak."
0841,['Sword'],"It ate a sour apple, and that induced its evolution. In its cheeks, it stores an acid capable of causing chemical burns."
0841,['Shield'],It flies on wings of apple skin and spits a powerful acid. It can also change its shape into that of an apple.
0841,['Scarlet'],"It flutters around while seeking an opening in the opponent’s guard, then attacks by spitting acidic liquid strong enough to melt metal."
0841,['Violet'],It uses its own body fluid to repair its apple. Strong Flapple that have won many battles have apples that are clay colored all over.
0842,['Sword'],"Eating a sweet apple caused its evolution. A nectarous scent wafts from its body, luring in the bug Pokémon it preys on."
0842,['Shield'],"Its body is covered in sweet nectar, and the skin on its back is especially yummy. Children used to have it as a snack."
0842,['Scarlet'],It feeds mainly on sweet apples. It will also eat small bug Pokémon that are attracted by its sweet nectar.
0842,['Violet'],"When some Lechonk come along to lick the sweet nectar on Appletun’s back, Appletun will spew sticky nectar at them to drive them away."
0843,['Sword'],"As it digs, it swallows sand and stores it in its neck pouch. The pouch can hold more than 17 pounds of sand."
0843,['Shield'],"It spews sand from its nostrils. While the enemy is blinded, it burrows into the ground to hide."
0843,['Scarlet'],"Silicobra’s neck pouch, which can inflate and deflate like a balloon, gets more elastic each time Silicobra sheds its skin."
0843,['Violet'],"Silicobra’s large nostrils are specialized for spraying sand, so this Pokémon is not very good at telling apart different smells."
0844,['Sword'],"When it contracts its body, over 220 pounds of sand sprays from its nose. If it ever runs out of sand, it becomes disheartened."
0844,['Shield'],Its unique style of coiling allows it to blast sand out of its sand sac more efficiently.
0844,['Scarlet'],"It will expand its body as much as it can and then contract itself, blasting out sand with enough force to wash away a dump truck."
0844,['Violet'],"The sand it spews contains sharp, pointy gravel, which is actually just sand that Sandaconda’s saliva has hardened into irregular shapes."
0845,['Sword'],"It’s so strong that it can knock out some opponents in a single hit, but it also may forget what it’s battling midfight."
0845,['Shield'],"This hungry Pokémon swallows Arrokuda whole. Occasionally, it makes a mistake and tries to swallow a Pokémon other than its preferred prey."
0846,['Sword'],"If it sees any movement around it, this Pokémon charges for it straightaway, leading with its sharply pointed jaw. It’s very proud of that jaw."
0846,['Shield'],"After it’s eaten its fill, its movements become extremely sluggish. That’s when Cramorant swallows it up."
0846,['Scarlet'],Arrokuda can swim quickly only in a straight line. The ones that become sluggish from overeating are the first to be targeted by flocks of Wattrel.
0846,['Violet'],"It takes down prey by charging into them with its hard, pointed jaw. But Arrokuda’s eyesight is poor, so this tactic has a low success rate."
0847,['Sword'],"This Pokémon has a jaw that’s as sharp as a spear and as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda’s flesh is surprisingly tasty, too."
0847,['Shield'],"It spins its tail fins to propel itself, surging forward at speeds of over 100 knots before ramming prey and spearing into them."
0847,['Scarlet'],"It spins its tail fins to leap from the water, then viciously bites down on Wingull flying close to the water’s surface."
0847,['Violet'],It swims at speeds of over 100 knots and battles fiercely with pods of Finizen over prey.
0848,['Sword'],"It stores poison in an internal poison sac and secretes that poison through its skin. If you touch this Pokémon, a tingling sensation follows."
0848,['Shield'],"It manipulates the chemical makeup of its poison to produce electricity. The voltage is weak, but it can cause a tingling paralysis."
0848,['Scarlet'],It has no problem drinking dirty water. An organ inside Toxel’s body filters such water into a poisonous liquid that is harmless to Toxel.
0848,['Violet'],"This selfish, attention-seeking Pokémon stores poison and electricity in two different sacs inside its body."
0849,['Sword'],"When this Pokémon sounds as if it’s strumming a guitar, it’s actually clawing at the protrusions on its chest to generate electricity."
0849,['Shield'],This short-tempered and aggressive Pokémon chugs stagnant water to absorb any toxins it might contain.
0849,['Scarlet'],"As it scatters toxic sweat and emits electricity, a melody that sounds like it came from a guitar reverberates through the surrounding area."
0849,['Violet'],"The jolts of electricity it launches by violently strumming the protrusions on its chest easily exceed 15,000 volts."
0849,['Sword'],"When this Pokémon sounds as if it’s strumming a guitar, it’s actually clawing at the protrusions on its chest to generate electricity."
0849,['Shield'],This short-tempered and aggressive Pokémon chugs stagnant water to absorb any toxins it might contain.
0849,['Scarlet'],"As it scatters toxic sweat and emits electricity, a melody that sounds like it came from a guitar reverberates through the surrounding area."
0849,['Violet'],"The jolts of electricity it launches by violently strumming the protrusions on its chest easily exceed 15,000 volts."
0850,['Sword'],It stores flammable gas in its body and uses it to generate heat. The yellow sections on its belly get particularly hot.
0850,['Shield'],"It wraps prey up with its heated body, cooking them in its coils. Once they’re well-done, it will voraciously nibble them down to the last morsel."
0851,['Sword'],"When it heats up, its body temperature reaches about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. It lashes its body like a whip and launches itself at enemies."
0851,['Shield'],"While its burning body is already dangerous on its own, this excessively hostile Pokémon also has large and very sharp fangs."
0852,['Sword'],"It’s very curious, but its means of investigating things is to try to punch them with its tentacles. The search for food is what brings it onto land."
0852,['Shield'],"Its tentacles tear off easily, but it isn’t alarmed when that happens—it knows they’ll grow back. It’s about as smart as a three-year-old."
0853,['Sword'],A body made up of nothing but muscle makes the grappling moves this Pokémon performs with its tentacles tremendously powerful.
0853,['Shield'],"Searching for an opponent to test its skills against, it emerges onto land. Once the battle is over, it returns to the sea."
0854,['Sword'],"The swirl pattern in this Pokémon’s body is its weakness. If it gets stirred, the swirl loses its shape, and Sinistea gets dizzy."
0854,['Shield'],"It absorbs the life-force of those who drink it. It waits patiently, but opportunities are fleeting— it tastes so bad that it gets spat out immediately."
0854,['Scarlet'],"Some fanatics will go to great pains to prepare the perfect tea and teacup, eagerly waiting for a Sinistea to come and possess their selections."
0854,['Violet'],"This Sinistea lives in an antique teacup. As valuable as this Pokémon is, its awful taste remains unchanged."
0855,['Sword'],Trainers Polteageist trusts will be allowed to experience its distinctive flavor and aroma firsthand by sampling just a tiny bit of its tea.
0855,['Shield'],"When angered, it launches tea from its body at the offender’s mouth. The tea causes strong chills if swallowed."
0855,['Scarlet'],Apparently a Polteageist’s disposition is affected by the type of tea the Pokémon came from. What teapot it inhabits makes no difference.
0855,['Violet'],"Though risky to drink, this Pokémon’s tea tastes delicious. Gourmets who have no fear of danger drink Polteageist tea day after day."
0856,['Sword'],"Via the protrusion on its head, it senses other creatures’ emotions. If you don’t have a calm disposition, it will never warm up to you."
0856,['Shield'],"If this Pokémon senses a strong emotion, it will run away as fast as it can. It prefers areas without people."
0856,['Scarlet'],"Because the emotions of others constantly flow into its head, this Pokémon prefers environments where no other creatures live."
0856,['Violet'],"It senses the feelings of other living creatures. Be careful not to expose it to strong emotions for too long, or it will end up exhausted."
0857,['Sword'],"No matter who you are, if you bring strong emotions near this Pokémon, it will silence you violently."
0857,['Shield'],"Using the braids on its head, it pummels foes to get them to quiet down. One blow from those braids would knock out a professional boxer."
0857,['Scarlet'],"To this Pokémon, strong emotions apparently feel like incredibly loud noises—even if the emotions are happy ones."
0857,['Violet'],"The moment this Pokémon finds someone who’s emitting strong emotions, it will pummel them senseless with its braids to silence them."
0858,['Sword'],It emits psychic power strong enough to cause headaches as a deterrent to the approach of others.
0858,['Shield'],"If you’re too loud around it, you risk being torn apart by the claws on its tentacle. This Pokémon is also known as the Forest Witch."
0858,['Scarlet'],"Hatterene knocks out those that intrude in its home forest by blasting them with a beam, then slashing with claws enhanced by psychic power."
0858,['Violet'],Beware of forests that show no signs of living creatures within. You may have wandered into Hatterene’s territory.
0859,['Sword'],"Through its nose, it sucks in the emanations produced by people and Pokémon when they feel annoyed. It thrives off this negative energy."
0859,['Shield'],"It sneaks into people’s homes, stealing things and feasting on the negative energy of the frustrated occupants."
0859,['Scarlet'],The reason this Pokémon causes trouble for those it feels close to is because Impidimp itself gets irritable if it can’t absorb negative emotions.
0859,['Violet'],"They live in groups, pestering and playing pranks on each other to polish their troublemaking skills."
0860,['Sword'],"When it gets down on all fours as if to beg for forgiveness, it’s trying to lure opponents in so that it can stab them with its spear-like hair."
0860,['Shield'],"With sly cunning, it tries to lure people into the woods. Some believe it to have the power to make crops grow."
0860,['Scarlet'],"Morgrem prefers dirty tactics, like ambushing, because it doesn’t have confidence in its brawn."
0860,['Violet'],This Pokémon absorbs negative emotions and turns them into energy. It’s popular with people who tend to think gloomy thoughts.
0861,['Sword'],"With the hair wrapped around its body helping to enhance its muscles, this Pokémon can overwhelm even Machamp."
0861,['Shield'],"Its hairs work like muscle fibers. When its hairs unfurl, they latch on to opponents, ensnaring them as tentacles would."
0861,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon has complete control over its hair. Grimmsnarl normally keeps its hair wrapped around its body to support its muscles.
0861,['Violet'],"It lives deep within the forest. Even after evolving into this splendid form, it hasn’t given up on its petty misdeeds and pranks."
0862,['Sword'],Its voice is staggering in volume. Obstagoon has a tendency to take on a threatening posture and shout—this move is known as Obstruct.
0862,['Shield'],"It evolved after experiencing numerous fights. While crossing its arms, it lets out a shout that would make any opponent flinch."
0863,['Sword'],What appears to be an iron helmet is actually hardened hair. This Pokémon lives for the thrill of battle.
0863,['Shield'],"After many battles, it evolved dangerous claws that come together to form daggers when extended."
0864,['Sword'],Its shell is overflowing with its heightened otherworldly energy. The ectoplasm serves as protection for this Pokémon’s core spirit.
0864,['Shield'],Be cautious of the ectoplasmic body surrounding its soul. You’ll become stiff as stone if you touch it.
0865,['Sword'],"Only Farfetch’d that have survived many battles can attain this evolution. When this Pokémon’s leek withers, it will retire from combat."
0865,['Shield'],"After deflecting attacks with its hard leaf shield, it strikes back with its sharp leek stalk. The leek stalk is both weapon and food."
0866,['Sword'],It’s highly skilled at tap-dancing. It waves its cane of ice in time with its graceful movements.
0866,['Shield'],Its amusing movements make it very popular. It releases its psychic power from the pattern on its belly.
0867,['Sword'],"A powerful curse was woven into an ancient painting. After absorbing the spirit of a Yamask, the painting began to move."
0867,['Shield'],"Never touch its shadowlike body, or you’ll be shown the horrific memories behind the picture carved into it."
0868,['Sword'],This Pokémon was born from sweet-smelling particles in the air. Its body is made of cream.
0868,['Shield'],They say that any patisserie visited by Milcery is guaranteed success and good fortune.
0869,['Sword'],"The moment it evolved, it took on a bitter flavor. This is because of the way its cells spontaneously shifted during evolution."
0869,['Shield'],"The cells that compose its cream fluctuated suddenly during evolution, giving the cream a bitter flavor."
0870,['Sword'],"Five of them are troopers, and one is the brass. The brass’s orders are absolute."
0870,['Shield'],"The six of them work together as one Pokémon. Teamwork is also their battle strategy, and they constantly change their formation as they fight."
0870,['Scarlet'],"The brass, which is the one that stands at the front and issues orders, is the strongest and smartest of the six."
0870,['Violet'],"The leader, known as the brass, uses its extendible horn to issue orders to the others when it’s time to change formation."
0871,['Sword'],"It feeds on seaweed, using its teeth to scrape it off rocks. Electric current flows from the tips of its spines."
0871,['Shield'],"It stores electricity in each spine. Even if one gets broken off, it still continues to emit electricity for at least three hours."
0871,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon generates electricity when it digests food. It uses its five hard teeth to scrape seaweed off surfaces and eat it.
0871,['Violet'],This Pokémon is so timid that even brushing against seaweed will make it discharge electricity in surprise. Its lips do not conduct electricity.
0872,['Sword'],"It spits out thread imbued with a frigid sort of energy and uses it to tie its body to branches, disguising itself as an icicle while it sleeps."
0872,['Shield'],"It eats snow that piles up on the ground. The more snow it eats, the bigger and more impressive the spikes on its back grow."
0872,['Scarlet'],"It eats snow that has accumulated on the ground. It prefers soft, freshly fallen snow, so it will eat its way up a mountain, aiming for the peak."
0872,['Violet'],"Within its internal organs, Snom amplifies the frigid air it gets from eating snow and then uses this amplified air to create icicle-like spikes."
0873,['Sword'],Icy scales fall from its wings like snow as it flies over fields and mountains. The temperature of its wings is less than −290 degrees Fahrenheit.
0873,['Shield'],"It shows no mercy to any who desecrate fields and mountains. It will fly around on its icy wings, causing a blizzard to chase offenders away."
0873,['Scarlet'],"Frosmoth senses air currents with its antennae. It sends its scales drifting on frigid air, making them fall like snow."
0873,['Violet'],"It causes blizzards as it flies around with its huge, chill-emanating wings. Clean meltwater is its favorite thing to drink."
0874,['Sword'],"It stands in grasslands, watching the sun’s descent from zenith to horizon. This Pokémon has a talent for delivering dynamic kicks."
0874,['Shield'],"Once a year, on a specific date and at a specific time, they gather out of nowhere and form up in a circle."
0874,['Scarlet'],The elemental composition of the rocks that form its body were found to match the bedrock of a land far away from this Pokémon’s habitat.
0874,['Violet'],This Pokémon spends its life gazing at the setting sun. It strides leisurely across grassy plains on legs of rock that weigh over 400 pounds each.
0875,['Sword'],It drifted in on the flow of ocean waters from a frigid place. It keeps its head iced constantly to make sure it stays nice and cold.
0875,['Shield'],"This Pokémon keeps its heat-sensitive head cool with ice. It fishes for its food, dangling its single hair into the sea to lure in prey."
0875,['Scarlet'],"On hot days, these Pokémon press their ice cube heads together and pass the time cooling each other down."
0875,['Violet'],"If you lick the ice covering its face, you’ll find it has a faintly salty taste. This species rode here on ocean currents from a cold, faraway land."

0875,['Violet'],"If you lick the ice covering its face, you’ll find it has a faintly salty taste. This species rode here on ocean currents from a cold, faraway land."
0876,['Sword'],"It uses the horns on its head to sense the emotions of others. Males will act as valets for those they serve, looking after their every need."
0876,['Shield'],"Through its horns, it can pick up on the emotions of creatures around it. Positive emotions are the source of its strength."
0876,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon picks up on the positive emotions of other creatures via its horns and uses those emotions to fuel itself.
0876,['Violet'],This Pokémon never leaves its Trainer’s side. It predicts their actions with its psychic power and takes care of their day-to-day needs.
0876,['Sword'],"It uses the horns on its head to sense the emotions of others. Males will act as valets for those they serve, looking after their every need."

0876,['Violet'],This Pokémon never leaves its Trainer’s side. It predicts their actions with its psychic power and takes care of their day-to-day needs.
0877,['Sword'],"As it eats the seeds stored up in its pocket-like pouches, this Pokémon is not just satisfying its constant hunger. It’s also generating electricity."
0877,['Shield'],"It carries electrically roasted seeds with it as if they’re precious treasures. No matter how much it eats, it always gets hungry again in short order."
0877,['Sword'],"As it eats the seeds stored up in its pocket-like pouches, this Pokémon is not just satisfying its constant hunger. It’s also generating electricity."
0877,['Shield'],"It carries electrically roasted seeds with it as if they’re precious treasures. No matter how much it eats, it always gets hungry again in short order."
0878,['Sword'],"It digs up the ground with its trunk. It’s also very strong, being able to carry loads of over five tons without any problem at all."
0878,['Shield'],"If a job requires serious strength, this Pokémon will excel at it. Its copper body tarnishes in the rain, turning a vibrant green color."
0878,['Scarlet'],"Using the pointy tip of its trunk, it carves off chunks of hard rocks to eat. It is very docile and helps people with physical labor."
0878,['Violet'],"Cufant can lift loads weighing five tons. In the mornings, it heads into caves with its herd, in search of the ore on which these Pokémon feed."
0879,['Sword'],They came over from another region long ago and worked together with humans. Their green skin is resistant to water.
0879,['Shield'],"These Pokémon live in herds. Their trunks have incredible grip strength, strong enough to crush giant rocks into powder."
0879,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon was brought to Paldea long ago by people from a faraway land. It’s so strong that it can easily pull an airplane.
0879,['Violet'],"Copperajah are prideful, cantankerous Pokémon. Specimens with vibrant green skin command the respect of others of their kind."
0880,['Sword'],"In ancient times, it was unbeatable thanks to its powerful lower body, but it went extinct anyway after it depleted all its plant-based food sources."
0880,['Shield'],"The powerful muscles in its tail generate its electricity. Compared to its lower body, its upper half is entirely too small."
0881,['Sword'],The shaking of its freezing upper half is what generates its electricity. It has a hard time walking around.
0881,['Shield'],This Pokémon lived on prehistoric seashores and was able to preserve food with the ice on its body. It went extinct because it moved so slowly.
0882,['Sword'],Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator of its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was what drove it to extinction.
0882,['Shield'],"Its mighty legs are capable of running at speeds exceeding 40 mph, but this Pokémon can’t breathe unless it’s underwater."
0883,['Sword'],"Though it’s able to capture prey by freezing its surroundings, it has trouble eating the prey afterward because its mouth is on top of its head."
0883,['Shield'],"The skin on its face is impervious to attack, but breathing difficulties made this Pokémon go extinct anyway."
0884,['Sword'],"Its body resembles polished metal, and it’s both lightweight and strong. The only drawback is that it rusts easily."
0884,['Shield'],"The special metal that composes its body is very light, so this Pokémon has considerable agility. It lives in caves because it dislikes the rain."
0885,['Sword'],"After being reborn as a ghost Pokémon, Dreepy wanders the areas it used to inhabit back when it was alive in prehistoric seas."
0885,['Shield'],"If this weak Pokémon is by itself, a mere child could defeat it. But if Dreepy has friends to help it train, it can evolve and become much stronger."
0885,['Scarlet'],"In the evening, groups of Dreepy will fly at high speeds over the ocean and poke at Pokémon in the water for fun."
0885,['Violet'],It has a habit of biting at Clauncher even though it doesn’t feed on them. This is said to be vestigial behavior from when Dreepy was alive.
0886,['Sword'],It’s capable of flying faster than 120 mph. It battles alongside Dreepy and dotes on them until they successfully evolve.
0886,['Shield'],"Without a Dreepy to place on its head and care for, it gets so uneasy it’ll try to substitute any Pokémon it finds for the missing Dreepy."
0886,['Scarlet'],"This Pokémon flies around at over 120 miles per hour. If a Drakloak is defeated in a battle, its Dreepy will wander off without a second thought."
0886,['Violet'],"This Pokémon stores up energy in its lungs, then shoots it out. It takes care of Dreepy and battles alongside them until they’re all grown up."
0887,['Sword'],"When it isn’t battling, it keeps Dreepy in the holes on its horns. Once a fight starts, it launches the Dreepy like supersonic missiles."
0887,['Shield'],Apparently the Dreepy inside Dragapult’s horns eagerly look forward to being launched out at Mach speeds.
0887,['Scarlet'],Dragapult can make its whole body transparent by clearing its mind and focusing. Even the Dreepy in Dragapult’s horns become invisible.
0887,['Violet'],The fastest Dragapult of the group is always surrounded by Dreepy that want to fly at sonic speed.
0888,['Sword'],"Known as a legendary hero, this Pokémon absorbs metal particles, transforming them into a weapon it uses to battle."
0888,['Shield'],This Pokémon has slumbered for many years. Some say it’s Zamazenta’s elder sister—others say the two Pokémon are rivals.

0888,['Shield'],This Pokémon has slumbered for many years. Some say it’s Zamazenta’s elder sister—others say the two Pokémon are rivals.
0889,['Sword'],"In times past, it worked together with a king of the people to save the Galar region. It absorbs metal that it then uses in battle."
0889,['Shield'],"This Pokémon slept for aeons while in the form of a statue. It was asleep for so long, people forgot that it ever existed."

0889,['Shield'],"This Pokémon slept for aeons while in the form of a statue. It was asleep for so long, people forgot that it ever existed."
0890,['Sword'],The core on its chest absorbs energy emanating from the lands of the Galar region. This energy is what allows Eternatus to stay active.
0890,['Shield'],"It was inside a meteorite that fell 20,000 years ago. There seems to be a connection between this Pokémon and the Dynamax phenomenon."

0890,['Shield'],"It was inside a meteorite that fell 20,000 years ago. There seems to be a connection between this Pokémon and the Dynamax phenomenon."
0891,['Sword'],Kubfu trains hard to perfect its moves. The moves it masters will determine which form it takes when it evolves.
0891,['Shield'],"If Kubfu pulls the long white hair on its head, its fighting spirit heightens and power wells up from the depths of its belly."
0892,['Sword'],People call it the embodiment of rage. It’s said that this Pokémon’s terrifying expression and shout will rid the world of malevolence.
0892,['Shield'],The energy released by this Pokémon’s fists forms shock waves that can blow away Dynamax Pokémon in just one hit.

0892,['Shield'],The energy released by this Pokémon’s fists forms shock waves that can blow away Dynamax Pokémon in just one hit.
0893,['Sword'],"Within dense forests, this Pokémon lives in a pack with others of its kind. It’s incredibly aggressive, and the other Pokémon of the forest fear it."
0893,['Shield'],"Once the vines on Zarude’s body tear off, they become nutrients in the soil. This helps the plants of the forest grow."
0894,['Sword'],This Pokémon is a cluster of electrical energy. It’s said that removing the rings on Regieleki’s body will unleash the Pokémon’s latent power.
0894,['Shield'],Its entire body is made up of a single organ that generates electrical energy. Regieleki is capable of creating all Galar’s electricity.
0895,['Sword'],An academic theory proposes that Regidrago’s arms were once the head of an ancient dragon Pokémon. The theory remains unproven.
0895,['Shield'],Its body is composed of crystallized dragon energy. Regidrago is said to have the powers of every dragon Pokémon.
0896,['Sword'],"Glastrier emits intense cold from its hooves. It’s also a belligerent Pokémon—anything it wants, it takes by force."
0896,['Shield'],"Glastrier has tremendous physical strength, and the mask of ice covering its face is 100 times harder than diamond."
0897,['Sword'],It probes its surroundings with all its senses save one—it doesn’t use its sense of sight. Spectrier’s kicks are said to separate soul from body.
0897,['Shield'],"As it dashes through the night, Spectrier absorbs the life-force of sleeping creatures. It craves silence and solitude."
0898,['Sword'],"Calyrex is a merciful Pokémon, capable of providing healing and blessings. It reigned over the Galar region in times of yore."

0899,['Legends: Arceus'],The black orbs shine with an uncanny light when the Pokémon is erecting invisible barriers. The fur shed from its beard retains heat well and is a highly useful material for winter clothing.
0900,['Legends: Arceus'],"A violent creature that fells towering trees with its crude axes and shields itself with hard stone. If one should chance upon this Pokémon in the wilds, one’s only recourse is to flee."
0901,['Legends: Arceus'],I believe it was Hisui’s swampy terrain that gave Ursaluna its burly physique and newfound capacity to manipulate peat at will.

0903,['Legends: Arceus'],"Because of Sneasler’s virulent poison and daunting physical prowess, no other species could hope to best it on the frozen highlands. Preferring solitude, this species does not form packs."
0904,['Legends: Arceus'],Its lancelike spikes and savage temperament have earned it the nickname “sea fiend.” It slurps up poison to nourish itself.
0905,['Legends: Arceus'],"When it flies to this land from across the sea, the bitter winter comes to an end. According to legend, this Pokémon’s love gives rise to the budding of fresh life across Hisui."
0905,['Legends: Arceus'],"When it flies to this land from across the sea, the bitter winter comes to an end. According to legend, this Pokémon’s love gives rise to the budding of fresh life across Hisui."
0906,['Scarlet'],Its fluffy fur is similar in composition to plants. This Pokémon frequently washes its face to keep it from drying out.
0906,['Violet'],The sweet scent its body gives off mesmerizes those around it. The scent grows stronger when this Pokémon is in the sun.
0907,['Scarlet'],"Floragato deftly wields the vine hidden beneath its long fur, slamming the hard flower bud against its opponents."
0907,['Violet'],"The hardness of Floragato’s fur depends on the Pokémon’s mood. When Floragato is prepared to battle, its fur becomes pointed and needle sharp."
0908,['Scarlet'],"This Pokémon uses the reflective fur lining its cape to camouflage the stem of its flower, creating the illusion that the flower is floating."
0908,['Violet'],"With skillful misdirection, it rigs foes with pollen-packed flower bombs. Meowscarada sets off the bombs before its foes realize what’s going on."
0909,['Scarlet'],It lies on warm rocks and uses the heat absorbed by its square-shaped scales to create fire energy.
0909,['Violet'],"Its flame sac is small, so energy is always leaking out. This energy is released from the dent atop Fuecoco’s head and flickers to and fro."
0910,['Scarlet'],The combination of Crocalor’s fire energy and overflowing vitality has caused an egg-shaped fireball to appear on the Pokémon’s head.
0910,['Violet'],The valve in Crocalor’s flame sac is closely connected to its vocal cords. This Pokémon utters a guttural cry as it spews flames every which way.
0911,['Scarlet'],The fiery bird changes shape when Skeledirge sings. Rumor has it that the bird was born when the fireball on Skeledirge’s head gained a soul.
0911,['Violet'],"Skeledirge’s gentle singing soothes the souls of all that hear it. It burns its enemies to a crisp with flames of over 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit."
0912,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon migrated to Paldea from distant lands long ago. The gel secreted by its feathers repels water and grime.
0912,['Violet'],Its strong legs let it easily swim around in even fast-flowing rivers. It likes to keep things tidy and is prone to overthinking things.
0913,['Scarlet'],"These Pokémon constantly run through shallow waters to train their legs, then compete with each other to see which of them kicks most gracefully."
0913,['Violet'],The hardworking Quaxwell observes people and Pokémon from various regions and incorporates their movements into its own dance routines.
0914,['Scarlet'],A single kick from a Quaquaval can send a truck rolling. This Pokémon uses its powerful legs to perform striking dances from far-off lands.
0914,['Violet'],"Dancing in ways that evoke far-away places, this Pokémon mesmerizes all that see it. Flourishes of its decorative water feathers slice into its foes."
0915,['Scarlet'],It searches for food all day. It possesses a keen sense of smell but doesn’t use it for anything other than foraging.
0915,['Violet'],This Pokémon spurns all but the finest of foods. Its body gives off an herblike scent that bug Pokémon detest.
0916,['Scarlet'],"Oinkologne is proud of its fine, glossy skin. It emits a concentrated scent from the tip of its tail."
0916,['Violet'],"It entrances female Pokémon with the sweet, alluring scent that wafts from all over its body."
0916,['Scarlet'],"Oinkologne is proud of its fine, glossy skin. It emits a concentrated scent from the tip of its tail."
0916,['Violet'],"It entrances female Pokémon with the sweet, alluring scent that wafts from all over its body."
0917,['Scarlet'],"The ball of threads wrapped around its body is elastic enough to deflect the scythes of Scyther, this Pokémon’s natural enemy."
0917,['Violet'],The thread it secretes from its rear is as strong as wire. The secret behind the thread’s strength is the topic of ongoing research.
0918,['Scarlet'],It clings to branches and ceilings using its threads and moves without a sound. It takes out its prey before the prey even notices it.
0918,['Violet'],"Spidops covers its territory in tough, sticky threads to set up traps for intruders."
0919,['Scarlet'],"It has its third set of legs folded up. When it’s in a tough spot, this Pokémon jumps over 30 feet using the strength of its legs."
0919,['Violet'],It’s highly skilled at a fighting style in which it uses its jumping capabilities to dodge incoming attacks while also dealing damage to opponents.
0920,['Scarlet'],"When it decides to fight all out, it stands on its previously folded legs to enter Showdown Mode. It neutralizes its enemies in short order."
0920,['Violet'],"It uses its normally folded third set of legs when in Showdown Mode. This places a huge burden on its body, so it can’t stay in this mode for long."
0921,['Scarlet'],It has underdeveloped electric sacs on its cheeks. These sacs can produce electricity only if Pawmi rubs them furiously with the pads on its forepaws.
0921,['Violet'],The pads of its paws are electricity-discharging organs. Pawmi fires electricity from its forepaws while standing unsteadily on its hind legs.
0922,['Scarlet'],"When its group is attacked, Pawmo is the first to leap into battle, defeating enemies with a fighting technique that utilizes electric shocks."
0922,['Violet'],Pawmo uses a unique fighting technique in which it uses its forepaws to strike foes and zap them with electricity from its paw pads simultaneously.
0923,['Scarlet'],"This Pokémon normally is slow to react, but once it enters battle, it will strike down its enemies with lightning-fast movements."
0923,['Violet'],Pawmot’s fluffy fur acts as a battery. It can store the same amount of electricity as an electric car.
0924,['Scarlet'],"Exhibiting great teamwork, they use their incisors to cut pieces out of any material that might be useful for a nest, then make off with them."
0924,['Violet'],The pair sticks together no matter what. They split any food they find exactly in half and then eat it together.
0925,['Scarlet'],"The two little ones just appeared one day. The group might be a family of related Pokémon, but nobody knows for sure."
0925,['Violet'],"The larger pair protects the little ones during battles. When facing strong opponents, the whole group will join the fight."
0925,['Scarlet'],"The two little ones just appeared one day. The group might be a family of related Pokémon, but nobody knows for sure."
0925,['Violet'],"The larger pair protects the little ones during battles. When facing strong opponents, the whole group will join the fight."
0926,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon is smooth and moist to the touch. Yeast in Fidough’s breath induces fermentation in the Pokémon’s vicinity.
0926,['Violet'],"The yeast in Fidough’s breath is useful for cooking, so this Pokémon has been protected by people since long ago."
0927,['Scarlet'],"The pleasant aroma that emanates from this Pokémon’s body helps wheat grow, so Dachsbun has been treasured by farming villages."
0927,['Violet'],"The surface of this Pokémon’s skin hardens when exposed to intense heat, and its body has an appetizing aroma."
0928,['Scarlet'],It protects itself from enemies by emitting oil from the fruit on its head. This oil is bitter and astringent enough to make someone flinch.
0928,['Violet'],"This Pokémon converts nutrients into oil, which it stores in the fruit on its head. It can easily go a whole week without eating or drinking."
0929,['Scarlet'],"Dolliv shares its tasty, fresh-scented oil with others. This species has coexisted with humans since times long gone."
0929,['Violet'],"It basks in the sun to its heart’s content until the fruits on its head ripen. After that, Dolliv departs from human settlements and goes on a journey."
0930,['Scarlet'],"This calm Pokémon is very compassionate. It will share its delicious, nutrient-rich oil with weakened Pokémon."
0930,['Violet'],"This Pokémon drives back enemies by launching its rich, aromatic oil at them with enough force to smash a boulder."
0931,['Scarlet'],"These Pokémon prefer to live in cities. They form flocks based on the color of their feathers, and they fight over territory."
0931,['Violet'],"Green-feathered flocks hold the most sway. When they’re out searching for food in the mornings and evenings, it gets very noisy."
0931,['Scarlet'],"These Pokémon prefer to live in cities. They form flocks based on the color of their feathers, and they fight over territory."

0931,['Violet'],"Green-feathered flocks hold the most sway. When they’re out searching for food in the mornings and evenings, it gets very noisy."
0932,['Scarlet'],"It was born in a layer of rock salt deep under the earth. This species was particularly treasured in the old days, as they would share precious salt."
0932,['Violet'],"The ground scrapes its body as it travels, causing it to leave salt behind. Salt is constantly being created and replenished inside Nacli’s body."
0933,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon dry cures its prey by spraying salt over them. The curing process steals away the water in the prey’s body.
0933,['Violet'],It compresses rock salt inside its body and shoots out hardened salt pellets with enough force to perforate an iron sheet.
0934,['Scarlet'],Garganacl will rub its fingertips together and sprinkle injured Pokémon with salt. Even severe wounds will promptly heal afterward.
0934,['Violet'],"Many Pokémon gather around Garganacl, hoping to lick at its mineral-rich salt."
0935,['Scarlet'],"Burnt charcoal came to life and became a Pokémon. Possessing a fiery fighting spirit, Charcadet will battle even tough opponents."
0935,['Violet'],"Its firepower increases when it fights, reaching over 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. It likes berries that are rich in fat."
0936,['Scarlet'],Armarouge evolved through the use of a set of armor that belonged to a distinguished warrior. This Pokémon is incredibly loyal.
0936,['Violet'],"This Pokémon clads itself in armor that has been fortified by psychic and fire energy, and it shoots blazing fireballs."
0937,['Scarlet'],The fiery blades on its arms burn fiercely with the lingering resentment of a sword wielder who fell before accomplishing their goal.
0937,['Violet'],An old set of armor steeped in grudges caused this Pokémon’s evolution. Ceruledge cuts its enemies to pieces without mercy.
0938,['Scarlet'],"Tadbulb shakes its tail to generate electricity. If it senses danger, it will make its head blink on and off to alert its allies."
0938,['Violet'],"It floats using the electricity stored in its body. When thunderclouds are around, Tadbulb will float higher off the ground."
0939,['Scarlet'],"When this Pokémon expands and contracts its wobbly body, the belly-button dynamo in its stomach produces a huge amount of electricity."
0939,['Violet'],What appear to be eyeballs are actually organs for discharging the electricity generated by Bellibolt’s belly-button dynamo.
0940,['Scarlet'],"When its wings catch the wind, the bones within produce electricity. This Pokémon dives into the ocean, catching prey by electrocuting them."
0940,['Violet'],"These Pokémon make their nests on coastal cliffs. The nests have a strange, crackling texture, and they’re a popular delicacy."
0941,['Scarlet'],"Kilowattrel inflates its throat sac to amplify its electricity. By riding the wind, this Pokémon can fly over 430 miles in a day."
0941,['Violet'],"It uses its throat sac to store electricity generated by its wings. There’s hardly any oil in its feathers, so it is a poor swimmer."
0942,['Scarlet'],"It always scowls in an attempt to make opponents take it seriously, but even crying children will burst into laughter when they see Maschiff’s face."
0942,['Violet'],"Its well-developed jaw and fangs are strong enough to crunch through boulders, and its thick fat makes for an excellent defense."
0943,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon can store energy in its large dewlap. Mabosstiff unleashes this energy all at once to blow away enemies.
0943,['Violet'],"Mabosstiff loves playing with children. Though usually gentle, it takes on an intimidating look when protecting its family."
0944,['Scarlet'],"Though usually a mellow Pokémon, it will sink its sharp, poison-soaked front teeth into any that anger it, causing paralysis in the object of its ire."
0944,['Violet'],"To keep enemies away from its territory, it paints markings around its nest using a poisonous liquid that has an acrid odor."
0945,['Scarlet'],The color of the poisonous saliva depends on what the Pokémon eats. Grafaiai covers its fingers in its saliva and draws patterns on trees in forests.
0945,['Violet'],"Each Grafaiai paints its own individual pattern, and it will paint that same pattern over and over again throughout its life."
0946,['Scarlet'],A soul unable to move on to the afterlife was blown around by the wind until it got tangled up with dried grass and became a Pokémon.
0946,['Violet'],"Not even Bramblin knows where it is headed as it tumbles across the wilderness, blown by the wind. It loathes getting wet."
0947,['Scarlet'],"It will open the branches of its head to envelop its prey. Once it absorbs all the life energy it needs, it expels the prey and discards it."
0947,['Violet'],"Brambleghast wanders around arid regions. On rare occasions, mass outbreaks of these Pokémon will bury an entire town."
0948,['Scarlet'],Toedscool lives in muggy forests. The flaps that fall from its body are chewy and very delicious.
0948,['Violet'],"Though it looks like Tentacool, Toedscool is a completely different species. Its legs may be thin, but it can run at a speed of 30 mph."
0949,['Scarlet'],These Pokémon gather into groups and form colonies deep within forests. They absolutely hate it when strangers approach.
0949,['Violet'],"It coils its 10 tentacles around prey and sucks out their nutrients, causing the prey pain. The folds along the rim of its head are a popular delicacy."
0950,['Scarlet'],"Klawf hangs upside-down from cliffs, waiting for prey. But Klawf can’t remain in this position for long because its blood rushes to its head."
0950,['Violet'],"This Pokémon lives on sheer cliffs. It sidesteps opponents’ attacks, then lunges for their weak spots with its claws."
0951,['Scarlet'],"The more sunlight this Pokémon bathes in, the more spicy chemicals are produced by its body, and thus the spicier its moves become."
0951,['Violet'],Traditional Paldean dishes can be extremely spicy because they include the shed front teeth of Capsakid among their ingredients.
0952,['Scarlet'],The red head converts spicy chemicals into fire energy and blasts the surrounding area with a super spicy stream of flame.
0952,['Violet'],"The green head has turned vicious due to the spicy chemicals stimulating its brain. Once it goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it."
0953,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon creates a mud ball by mixing sand and dirt with psychic energy. It treasures its mud ball more than its own life.
0953,['Violet'],It rolls its mud ball around while the energy it needs for evolution matures. Eventually the time comes for it to evolve.
0954,['Scarlet'],"The body that supports the ball barely moves. Therefore, it is thought that the true body of this Pokémon is actually inside the ball."
0954,['Violet'],An infant sleeps inside the ball. Rabsca rolls the ball soothingly with its legs to ensure the infant sleeps comfortably.
0955,['Scarlet'],Flittle’s toes levitate about half an inch above the ground because of the psychic power emitted from the frills on the Pokémon’s belly.
0955,['Violet'],"It spends its time running around wastelands. If anyone steals its beloved berries, it will chase them down and exact its revenge."
0956,['Scarlet'],"It immobilizes opponents by bathing them in psychic power from its large eyes. Despite its appearance, it has a vicious temperament."
0956,['Violet'],It emits psychic power from the gaps between its multicolored frills and sprints at speeds greater than 120 mph.
0957,['Scarlet'],"It swings its handmade hammer around to protect itself, but the hammer is often stolen by Pokémon that eat metal."
0957,['Violet'],This Pokémon pounds iron scraps together to make a hammer. It will remake the hammer again and again until it’s satisfied with the result.
0958,['Scarlet'],"This Pokémon will attack groups of Pawniard and Bisharp, gathering metal from them in order to create a large and sturdy hammer."
0958,['Violet'],These Pokémon make their homes in piles of scrap metal. They test the strength of each other’s hammers by smashing them together.
0959,['Scarlet'],"This intelligent Pokémon has a very daring disposition. It knocks rocks into the sky with its hammer, aiming for flying Corviknight."
0959,['Violet'],"The hammer tops 220 pounds, yet it gets swung around easily by Tinkaton as it steals whatever it pleases and carries its plunder back home."
0960,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon can pick up the scent of a Veluza just over 65 feet away and will hide itself in the sand.
0960,['Violet'],"Though it looks like Diglett, Wiglett is an entirely different species. The resemblance seems to be a coincidental result of environmental adaptation."
0961,['Scarlet'],"It has a vicious temperament, contrary to what its appearance may suggest. It wraps its long bodies around prey, then drags the prey into its den."
0961,['Violet'],"A variety of fish Pokémon, Wugtrio was once considered to be a regional form of Dugtrio."
0962,['Scarlet'],"It gathers things up in an apron made from shed feathers added to the Pokémon’s chest feathers, then drops those things from high places for fun."
0962,['Violet'],"Bombirdier uses the apron on its chest to bundle up food, which it carries back to its nest. It enjoys dropping things that make loud noises."
0963,['Scarlet'],It likes playing with others of its kind using the water ring on its tail. It uses ultrasonic waves to sense the emotions of other living creatures.
0963,['Violet'],Its water ring is made from seawater mixed with a sticky fluid that Finizen secretes from its blowhole.
0964,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon changes its appearance if it hears its allies calling for help. Palafin will never show anybody its moment of transformation.
0964,['Violet'],"Its physical capabilities are no different than a Finizen’s, but when its allies are in danger, it transforms and powers itself up."
0964,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon changes its appearance if it hears its allies calling for help. Palafin will never show anybody its moment of transformation.
0964,['Violet'],"Its physical capabilities are no different than a Finizen’s, but when its allies are in danger, it transforms and powers itself up."
0965,['Scarlet'],It is said that this Pokémon was born when an unknown poison Pokémon entered and inspirited an engine left at a scrap-processing factory.
0965,['Violet'],The steel section is Varoom’s actual body. This Pokémon clings to rocks and converts the minerals within into energy to fuel its activities.
0966,['Scarlet'],It creates a gas out of poison and minerals from rocks. It then detonates the gas in its cylinders—now numbering eight—to generate energy.
0966,['Violet'],Revavroom viciously threatens others with the sound of its exhaust. It sticks its tongue out from its cylindrical mouth and sprays toxic fluids.
0967,['Scarlet'],"Apparently Cyclizar has been allowing people to ride on its back since ancient times. Depictions of this have been found in 10,000-year-old murals."
0967,['Violet'],It can sprint at over 70 mph while carrying a human. The rider’s body heat warms Cyclizar’s back and lifts the Pokémon’s spirit.
0968,['Scarlet'],"When attacked, this Pokémon will wield the tendrils on its body like fists and pelt the opponent with a storm of punches."
0968,['Violet'],This Pokémon lives in arid deserts. It maintains its metal body by consuming iron from the soil.
0969,['Scarlet'],It absorbs nutrients from cave walls. The petals it wears are made of crystallized poison.
0969,['Violet'],Glimmet’s toxic mineral crystals look just like flower petals. This Pokémon scatters poisonous powder like pollen to protect itself.
0970,['Scarlet'],"When this Pokémon detects danger, it will open up its crystalline petals and fire beams from its conical body."
0970,['Violet'],Glimmora’s petals are made of crystallized poison energy. It has recently become evident that these petals resemble Tera Jewels.
0971,['Scarlet'],It is said that a dog Pokémon that died in the wild without ever interacting with a human was reborn as this Pokémon.
0971,['Violet'],"This friendly Pokémon doesn’t like being alone. Pay it even the slightest bit of attention, and it will follow you forever."
0972,['Scarlet'],"Houndstone spends most of its time sleeping in graveyards. Among all the dog Pokémon, this one is most loyal to its master."
0972,['Violet'],A lovingly mourned Pokémon was reborn as Houndstone. It doesn’t like anyone touching the protuberance atop its head.
0973,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon apparently ties the base of its neck into a knot so that energy stored in its belly does not escape from its beak.
0973,['Violet'],"Thanks to a behavior of theirs known as “synchronizing,” an entire flock of these Pokémon can attack simultaneously in perfect harmony."
0974,['Scarlet'],This species left the ocean and began living on land a very long time ago. It seems to be closely related to Wailmer.
0974,['Violet'],It lives in frigid regions in pods of five or so individuals. It loves the minerals found in snow and ice.
0975,['Scarlet'],"This Pokémon wanders around snowy, icy areas. It protects its body with powerful muscles and a thick layer of fat under its skin."
0975,['Violet'],"Ice energy builds up in the horn on its upper jaw, causing the horn to reach cryogenic temperatures that freeze its surroundings."
0976,['Scarlet'],"When Veluza discards unnecessary flesh, its mind becomes honed and its psychic power increases. The spare flesh has a mild but delicious flavor."
0976,['Violet'],"Veluza has excellent regenerative capabilities. It sheds spare flesh from its body to boost its agility, then charges at its prey."
0977,['Scarlet'],"This Pokémon is a glutton, but it’s bad at getting food. It teams up with a Tatsugiri to catch prey."
0977,['Violet'],"It treats Tatsugiri like its boss and follows it loyally. Though powerful, Dondozo is apparently not very smart."
0978,['Scarlet'],This is a small dragon Pokémon. It lives inside the mouth of Dondozo to protect itself from enemies on the outside.
0978,['Violet'],"Tatsugiri is an extremely cunning Pokémon. It feigns weakness to lure in prey, then orders its partner to attack."

0979,['Scarlet'],"When its anger rose beyond a critical point, this Pokémon gained power that is unfettered by the limits of its physical body."
0979,['Violet'],It imbues its fists with the power of the rage that it kept hidden in its heart. Opponents struck by these imbued fists will be shattered to their core.
0980,['Scarlet'],"When attacked, this Pokémon will retaliate by sticking thick spines out from its body. It’s a risky move that puts everything on the line."
0980,['Violet'],It lives at the bottom of ponds and swamps. It will carry Wooper on its back and ferry them across water from one shore to the other.
0981,['Scarlet'],"Now that the brain waves from the head and tail are synced up, the psychic power of this Pokémon is 10 times stronger than Girafarig’s."
0981,['Violet'],The hardened head from the tail protects the head of the main body as Farigiraf whips its long neck around to headbutt enemies.
0982,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon uses its hard tail to make its nest by boring holes into bedrock deep underground. The nest can reach lengths of over six miles.
0982,['Violet'],"It drives enemies out of its nest by sucking in enough air to fill its long, narrow lungs, then releasing the air in an intense blast."

0982,['Violet'],"It drives enemies out of its nest by sucking in enough air to fill its long, narrow lungs, then releasing the air in an intense blast."
0983,['Scarlet'],Only a Bisharp that stands above all others in its vast army can evolve into Kingambit.
0983,['Violet'],"Though it commands a massive army in battle, it’s not skilled at devising complex strategies. It just uses brute strength to keep pushing."
0984,['Scarlet'],Sightings of this Pokémon have occurred in recent years. The name Great Tusk was taken from a creature listed in a certain book.
0984,['Violet'],"This creature resembles a mysterious Pokémon that, according to a paranormal magazine, has lived since ancient times."

0995,['Violet'],Some of its notable features match those of an object named within a certain expedition journal as Iron Thorns.

0997,['Scarlet'],"Arctibax freezes the air around it, protecting its face with an ice mask and turning its dorsal fin into a blade of ice."
0997,['Violet'],It attacks with the blade of its frozen dorsal fin by doing a front flip in the air. Arctibax’s strong back and legs allow it to pull off this technique.
0998,['Scarlet'],This Pokémon blasts cryogenic air out from its mouth. This air can instantly freeze even liquid-hot lava.
